Test subjects were physically and mentally tortured, deprived of sleep, infected with diseases and forcibly addicted to opium in order to study the effects on the body. \n\nMany experiments focused on using music or other audio stimuli to trigger mechanical responses in subjects. Prisoners were forced to repeat actions for days or weeks at a time while listening to short audio loops. Some were even bombarded with high pitch frequencies to see whether they disrupted regular bodily functions.\n\n<b>Conclusion</b>\nThe program was brought to an end by the liberation of Buchenwald by U.S. troops on April 4, 1945.

Considered one of the most innovative rock acts of the 1970s, they were noted for their dense, layered songs and use of experimental recording techniques.\n\n<b>Formation</b>\nTaylor and Ronson met in 1968 after participating in a study on the effects of LSD while students at MIT. They bonded over a shared a love of music and started writing songs together in Taylor's dormitory. Ronson, a physicist with a background in jazz music, was interested in how new studio technology could be used to create new kinds of sounds. Taylor was inspired by gospel and other congregational musical traditions, intending to create a form of music that was spiritual and transcendent. \n\n<b>Debut album</b>\nThe band entered the studio to record their first album in August 1971. This was a period of intense creativity, and Taylor and Ronson experimented with a variety of different recording technologies, often rewriting songs entirely to incorporate them. \n\nReleased on March 22, 1972, the untitled album, known as the <i>[[Unit LP|Unit LP (1972)]]</i>, spawned the hit single [[\"3:22\"]]. It was a commercial success, but Unit refused to tour or give any interviews in support of the album. This enigmatic behaviour contributed to the cult following that formed around the band. \n\n<b>Deaths of Taylor and Ronson</b>\nOn January 1, 1973, police responded to a call saying that gunshots had been heard coming from Ronson's home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Ronson and Taylor were both discovered dead from bullet wounds to the head. Investigators ruled that Ronson had shot Taylor twice in the head with a pistol before turning the gun on himself. A motive for the incident was never established.<sup>[[(1)|Report: Ronson/Taylor]]</sup>\n\nNews of the apparent murder/suicide of Taylor and Ronson saw a spike of sales for the <i>Unit LP</i>. There were rumours that the pair had recorded some songs for a follow-up LP, but no recordings were every located.\n</p>",

The show ran for three seasons, but the final episode never aired. A fire during the filming of the series finale killed many of the cast and production crew, after which <i>Unity</i> was cancelled.\n\n<b>Plot</b>\nSet in the year 3220, the show follows the crew of the starship USS Fortitude after it crash-lands on the planet Ourous. Led by Captain Ulysses Black (Rick Costello), the survivors find themselves in conflict with the Xar'al, an alien race with psychic abilities. With any one of the crew possibly under the control of the Xar'al, the crew work to overcome their distrust of one another and return home.\n\n<b>Production</b>\nIn early 1973, William Scott drafted a proposal for the science-fiction series that would become <i>Unity</i>. Scott intended the show to reflect the unease of the Cold War period, hence the Xar'al's ability to control minds and the paranoia that grips the crew.\n\nThe show was noted for many unconventional and formally ambitious episodes: the first season episode \"See No Evil\" was shot entirely from the first person perspective of one of the characters; the second season finale \"Song of Ilium\" was set entirely to music and contained no dialogue; the season three episode \"Parallels\" played two separate storylines at the same time in split screen. \n\nThe third season episode \"Lights Out\" was notable in that it appeared to predict the [[New York City blackout of 1977|New York Blackout]] a week before it happened. In the episode, the Fortitude suffers a massive power failure and the crew must repel a Xar'al attack in the dark. \n\n<b>Fire and cancellation</b>\nOn April 9, 1978, a fire broke out in the studio where the finale, [[\"Reflection\"|\"Reflection\" (Unity)]], was being filmed. Many of cast and crew, including show creator William Scott, were killed. The network subsequently cancelled the show without producing the episode.\n</p>",

He was the Chief SS Doctor (SS-Standortarzt) at Buchenwald concentration camp from January 1943 - April 1945, overseeing the infamous [[Unit 322 research programme|Unit 322]] into mind control. After the end of World War II, Reichardt worked as a researcher in the U.S. until his disappearance in 1972.\n\n<b>Early life and education</b>\nReichardt was born the youngest of three children to Dieter and Eva Reichardt in G\u00fcnzburg, Bavaria, Germany. He excelled at school from a  very young age and developed a keen interest in music. By the age of ten he had become proficient at the piano and regularly sang in school choirs. \n\nReichardt completed high school in 1931 and studied medicine at the Goethe University Frankfurt. In addition, he also studied at the University of Munich, eventually earning a PhD in anthropology. It was there that he became involved in student politics, joining the Nazi party and the <i>Schutzstaffel</i> (SS) in 1937.\n\n<b>Military service and Buchenwald</b>\nAfter the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Reichardt volunteered for medical service in the <i>Waffen-SS</i>. After serving as a battalion medical officer for the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking, he was posted to Buchenwald concentration camp as chief physician. \n\nIt was here that Reichardt oversaw the infamous [[Unit 322]] research program, performing deadly human experiments on prisoners. In particular, his research focused on using sound and music broadcasts to trigger responses in test subjects.<sup>[[(1)|Doctor's note one]]</sup>\n\n<b>U.S. research and disappearance</b>\nAfter the end of World War II, Reichardt was brought to the U.S. as part of [[Operation Paperclip]]. He worked on a number of projects for the U.S. government departments developing interrogation techniques to be used on foreign spies. He was also a part of the CIA's [[Project Ilium]] researching mind control. After the murder of the project's lead, [[Alison Bloom]], by the serial killer [[Tommy Gibson]], the program was terminated. Reichardt then went into hiding and has never been found.</p>\n",

We are such stupid creatures, so like every other animal, that precious little of the operation of the human machine is left to conscious thought. All of the body's vital mechanisms are regulated by the subconscious. The heart, for example, is an intricate timepiece that keeps us alive without us even having to contemplate it. \n\nEven behaviours we would deem representative of a civilised creature - dressing oneself, riding a bicycle, playing the piano - are quickly memorised and automated by our bodies. We sleepwalk through almost our entire lives.\n\nI believe the human body can be piloted, just like an aircraft or an automobile. One simply has to establish the interface through which to  bypass consciousness and initiate these learned behaviours. \n\nPavlov performed a neat parlour trick, making his dogs salivate with a ringing bell.

The brutal nature of Gibson's crimes, in which he would break into his victims' homes and skin them alive, brought a large amount of media attention.\n\n<b>Early life</b>\nGibson was born in San Diego, California to Elizabeth \"Betty\" Gibson, a single mother who worked several jobs to support her son. Gibson never knew his birth father. He had a troubled childhood, spending a lot of time alone at home and regularly getting into fights with other boys at school. \n\nAt age 18, Gibson joined the U.S. Army and served in Vietnam. After an honorable discharge in 1969, Gibson held a series of menial jobs, such as a high school janitor and sorter for the U.S. Postal Service. By 1972, he had moved to New York City and was working as a taxi driver. \n\n<b>Murders</b>\nOn March 22, 1972, Gibson broke into the house of Dr Edward Lee, tied him to a chair and removed his skin with a knife over a period of three hours. He then returned home, burned the blood-stained clothes and disposed of the murder weapon.\n\nOn March 27, 1972, Gibson forced his way into the home of [[Dr Alison Bloom|Alison Bloom]]. As with Lee, Gibson strapped Bloom to a chair and used a knife to take her skin off. Her body was not discovered until two days later.\n\nOn April 3, 1972, Gibson murdered his final victim, Eleanor Jones, a recovering drug addict. She was skinned alive by Gibson while her newborn baby was in the next room.\n\n<b>Arrest</b>\nFollowing the murder of Eleanor Jones, a neighbour spotted Gibson leaving the scene in his car and reported the license plate to the police. On April 5, 1972, Gibson was arrested and his house searched for evidence. Police found the clothes he was wearing during the Jones murder still covered in her blood, as well as the knife used to skin her.\n\nGibson was tried for all three homicides the following year. Despite claiming that he had no memory of committing the murders,<sup>[[(1)|Call #2]]</sup> he was found mentally competent to stand trail. Gibson was convicted of three counts of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\n<b>Incarceration and death</b>\nUpon sentencing, Gibson was transferred to Columbia Correctional Institution in Portage, Wisconsin. In November 1975, Gibson's throat was cut by another inmate and he bled to death. The attacker was never identified.</p>",

Produced by guitarist Don Ronson, it was recorded between August and December 1971. \n\n<b>Composition and recording</b>\nMany of the songs started with a single musical idea that repeated over and over, adding more instruments or sounds each time. The aim was to create a transcendent feeling in the listener by slowly overwhelming their senses. \n\nRonson and vocalist Reginald Taylor wrote the album with no intention of reproducing the material live, so they employed a number of innovative recording techniques, such as backwards recordings, tape loops and automatic double tracking to create a hypnotic, otherworldly sound. Ronson, a multi-instrumentalist, played guitar, bass and drums on the album. He also added organ, sitar, cello, banjo and trumpet parts to many tracks. \n\nTaylor, inspired by his background in gospel music, laid multiple takes of his vocals on top of each other to create the impression of a large choir. Different effects, such as reverb, were applied to different vocal takes to give the feeling of many different voices. \n\n<b>Reception</b>\nThe album was a commercial success, and the single [[\"3:22\"]] received significant radio play. Reviews were generally favourable, with many commenting on the sophistcated sound of the album. However, some reviewers wondered how two young students from MIT managed to fund such a technically accomplished album with no major label support.\n\n<b>Track Listing</b>\n<i>All songs written and performed by Taylor/Ronson</i>\n\nSide 1\n1.

From what little I've seen so far, this has Reichardt's stink all over it. It's also looking likely that this was responsible for the riots during the New York blackout last year.

The primary objective of Operation Paperclip was to exploit German scientific and technical expertise and give the U.S. military advantage against the Soviet Union in the Cold War. More than 1,600 Germans, many of them members of the Nazi party, were taken to the U.S. as part of the program.\n\n<b>Initiation and evacuation</b>\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) began the first recruitment program, Operation Overcast, on July 20, 1945. It was renamed Operation Paperclip in November 1945, after paperclips were affixed to the folders of Nazi personnel to indicate they should be brought to the America. President Truman officially approved the program on September 3, 1946. \n\nThe program began identifying, locating and capturing German research and technical personnel. Many had been evacuated to Saxony and Thuringia ahead of the fall of Berlin, and the U.S. began a concerted evacuation operation in these areas, transporting 1,800 scientists and their family members to America.\n\n<b>Arrival in the U.S.</b>\nMany United States military and civilian institutions employed personnel from Operation Paperclip. Wernher von Braun and his V-2 rocket team worked on an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) program, before later working on the Explorer 1 and Apollo initiatives at Nasa. \n\n[[Stefan Reichardt|The Doctor]], chief doctor at Buchenwald concentration camp, was employed by the CIA to develop various interrogation and behavioural control methods,<sup>[[(1)|Doctor's Note #2]]</sup> most notably on [[Project Ilium]].\n\n</p>",

Originating with British and American musicians in the mid 1960s, psychadelic rock is intended to mimic and enhance the experience of drugs such as LSD. The term applies to a wide range of different styles and genres.\n\n<b>Definition</b>\nAs a musical style, psychedelic rock incorporated elaborate studio techniques such as panning or phasing, unconventional song structures, improvisation, extended instrumental segments, and surreal or ambiguous lyrical content. \n\n<b>Notable acts</b>\nThe Beatles and the Beach Boys are generally considered two of the earliest progenitors of the genre, and both notably experimented with writing music while under the influence of psychedelic drugs. Other influential acts include The Doors and Jefferson Airplane. Despite psychedelic rock's drop in popularity in the early 1970s, the genre still produced some commercially successful groups, such as [[Unit]].\n</p>",

He is best remembered for creating the science-fiction series <i>[[Unity]]</i>. Born in Des Moines, Iowa, Scott was encouraged to read and write by his journalist father and librarian mother. After graduating from high school, he moved to California to pursue a career in screenwriting.\n\n<b>Career</b>\nScott started out as a freelance writer, writing scripts for numerous shows in the 1960s. He tried  to create several series of his own, including a series based on British police called <i>Bobbies</i> and a science-fction show called <i>Intrepid</i> pitched as \"Treasure Island in space\". None of them were picked up by networks.\n\nWith the help of a friend, Scott reworked aspects of the <i>Intrepid</i> idea into the show that would eventually become <i>Unity</i>. After successfully picthing the show, Scott was hired as producer. He wrote 21 of <i>Unity</i>'s 66 episodes and exercised a large amount of creative control during filming. \n\n<b>Death</b>\nScott wrote and directed the series finale, [[\"Reflection\"|\"Reflection\" (Unity)]], and was filming at a sound stage in Los Angeles on April 9, 1978. A short-circuit on a lighting rig started a fire that quickly engulfed the whole building. Scott and twenty other people, including many of <i>Unity</i>'s cast and crew, died in the blaze.</p>",

A series of lightning strikes tripped circuit breakers in numerous substations, leading to a loss of power to most of the city. The blackout resulted in widespread arson and looting.\n\n<b>Effects</b>\nBy 9:30 p.m. EDT, the blackout had affected almost all of New York City, though there were some unaffected neighbourhoods in southern Queens and the Rockaways. In the mostly poor neighbourhoods that were without power, looting, vandalism and arson was widespread.\n\nIn total, 1,616 stores were damaged and emergency services responded to 1,037 fires. At one point, two entire blocks of Broadway were on fire. The violence resulted in the largest mass arrest in the city's history, with 3,776 people arrested. The police reported that many of the arrested vandals claimed to have no memory of their actions. \n\nThe damage to the city was estimated by one study to be $300 million.\n\n<b>Causes</b>\nThere has been a lot of debate as to why the rioting occurred. The city was in the grip of a severe economic downturn and tensions were high over the Son of Sam murders. Some commentators saw the hot July weather as a contributing factor. One newspaper columnist even claimed that, due to the similarities between the blackout and the events of an episode of <i>[[Unity]]</i> the previous week, the show was somehow responsible.</p>",
