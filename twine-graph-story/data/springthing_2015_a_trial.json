You hope his tampering didn't corrupt your saves.\\n\\nSave 1 must be from after you captured your Genee. You saved right outside the Forbidding Caves, determined to find the Fallen Star that'd upgrade Genee to a Metatron. The Caves are dark as anything; it's not hard to lose your way. You tried dozens of times, never found the Star. You gave up and used a Sacred Flame instead to get Pyrotron. But you vowed to return and track down the Star.\\n\\nBy Save 2 you'd beaten the Council but you hadn't \"got 'em all.\" You'd bought a season pass to the Wilds in hopes of capturing the rare Pockm_n found there. Then the season passed and you got stuck in the Wilds and that's about when you thought you lost the GBC on the car trip.\\n\\nYou've no clue where your friend might be in the game.

You share proximity, common language and currency, often a flag, most always a constitution. Most are born into one country or another. Almost all stay in that same country until they die.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cDoes everyone have a country?\u201d\\n\\nA long pause. \u201cNot everyone, but most everyone.\u201d Another pause. \u201cYou ought not worry yourself.

We war, as you do, out of pride or fear, but never with the intent of total destruction. Irreparable divides do arise within countries, usually in response to some extraordinary new circumstance.

      "text": "The Emperor, so a parable runs, has sent a message to you, the humble subject, the insignificant shadow cowering in the remotest distance before the imperial sun; the Emperor from his deathbed has sent a message to you alone. He has commanded the messenger to kneel down by the bed, and has whispered the message to him; so much store did he lay on it that he ordered the messenger to whisper it back into his ear again. Then by a nod of his head he has confirmed that it is right. Yes, before the assembled spectators of his death--all the obstructing walls have been broken down, and on the spacious and loftily mounting open staircases stand in a ring the great princes of the Empire--before all these he has delivered his message. \\n\\nThe messenger immediately sets out on his journey; a powerful, an indefatigable man; now pushing with his right arm, now with his left, he cleaves a way for himself through the throng; if he encounters resistance he points to his breast, where the symbol of the sun glitters; the way is made easier for him than it would be for any other man. But the multitudes are so vast; their numbers have no end. If he could reach the open fields how fast he would fly, and soon doubtless you would hear the welcome hammering of his fists on your door. \\n\\nBut instead how vainly does he wear out his strength; still he is only making his way through the chambers of the innermost palace; never will he get to the end of them; and if he succeeded in that nothing would be gained; he must next fight his way down the stair; and if he succeeded in that nothing would be gained; the courts would still have to be crossed; and after the courts the second outer palace; and once more stairs and courts; and once more another palace; and so on for thousands of years; and if at last he should burst through the outermost gate--but never, never can that happen--the imperial capital would lie before him, the center of the world, crammed to bursting with its own sediment. Nobody could fight his way through here even with a message from a dead man. But you sit at your window when evening falls and dream it to yourself.\\n\\nKafka, An Imperial Message (trans. Willa and Edwin Muir)",

This is why utopias permit fables and discourse: they run with the very grain of language and are part of the fundamental dimension of the //fabula//; heterotopias (such as those to be found so often in Borges) desiccate speech, stop words in their tracks, contest the very possibility of grammar at its source; they dissolve our myths and sterilize the lyricism of our sentences.\\n\\nMichel Foucault, Preface to //The Order of Things//",

      "text": "Interlude: A Hand Story\\n\\nI have to hand it over to you: this egg that I found in a burrow behind the dispensary. Not because you compelled me to give you it, or even asked for it, or even knew I had it, or even knew of it: you did not. Not because the egg told me to: it did, but it is only an egg and so what does it know.\\n\\nNo, this (my entrusting the egg to your care) is nothing more than a matter of conscience on my part. It is not a cowardice -- of course my first instinct was to watch over the egg myself! In point of fact, I have done just that these past several weeks. And to the absolute limit of my abilities: I tell you there is nothing (nothing save my pursuit of Ann) that I have taken up with more devotion.\\n\\nIn spite of my best efforts, a preponderance of evidence has shown that I am, if not //the// worst, at least among the worst possible caretakers for the egg. (I cannot help but wonder if that very unfitness led me to chance upon the egg in the first place-- but I will not distract you with such speculations.) [[The faintest hint|red_next3]] of such evidence should be enough to convince you that such is indeed the case, so I will be brief.\\n\\n.--.-.\\n\\nFirst there is the matter of my hands. They are huge and next to useless. You know this well, having once shaken my hand. (We have since turned to hugs, leading us to the problem of shoulders-- but I am getting ahead of myself.) Their hugeness and uselessness is of a piece: they are not useless //because// they are huge, any more than they are huge because they are useless. It is one and the same.\\n\\nThey are a waste, an enormity, a barren expanse. Not a desert, where cacti might flower and hares might frolic. Not a blank slate, as such a space holds promise. They are perhaps closest to an ocean of lead, if lead were stripped of its industrial applications and left as pure poison. In my hands nothing sprouts, nothing flourishes: how could any good come of nesting the egg in them?\\n\\nNot that I was so careless as to cradle the egg for even a second in my bare palms! Of course I have taken precautions, of course. But what you might not understand (having small, fine hands) is that their sprawl inevitably infects all they touch. Even this very pen -- sharp, compact, to-the-point -- already it splutters out blots and it fails me, floods the page with extraneity. When all my wrists wish to express is an unadorned and earnest, modest truth, my huge hands find some way to divert, to delay. And how much the more so with this egg![...] \\n\\n\\n",

Isn\u2019t there some way to prove that, sort it out?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cYou do not have any valid ID.\u201d No question there. \u201cThat poses some difficulty, sir,\u201d a very long pause, \u201cbut it is not insurmountable.\u201d They tap away at their console. \u201cWe have provisional metrics attached to each ticket-holder. We also have an expressive platform synched up to those metrics.\u201d Another pause. \u201cIf you joined that platform, sir, and expressed yourself in such a way as to match the metrics attached to ticket #44, then you would have solid grounds for replacing whoever currently fills that appointment.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cUm. Okay?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cThat there is the terminal room, sir.\u201d They point to a door. \u201cThe terminal counter is over that way.

Let me tell you another story, a happy story:\\n\\nOnce there was a princess so lovely she shone like a second sun. Her loveliness was, as you can imagine, hard on her parents, and even harder on her two lovely-but-not-that-lovely sisters. It was hardest on her because no-one could make eye contact, which is a very important component of child development.\\n\\nFortunately, as royalty her parents had access to every resource she could ever need. (Most other children as lovely as second suns end up human supernovae.) The physicians tried various lenses, masks, veils, potions, etc., but every effort failed. Finally, her family went with the last resort. They took the princess to the Isle of Harpies.\\n\\nAll harpies have perfect 20/10 color vision, but no harpy can see beauty. They appreciate mundanity and ugliness as well as anyone -- they see nothing as beautiful. So they were the perfect caretakers for this excruciatingly lovely princess. They were sharp and attentive and not a little funny: so too was the princess.\\n\\nShe grew her claws, her wings, her foul mane out among them-- she grew outrageous. Her family's eyes no longer burned looking at her; instead their guts turned traitor on their lungs. They almost ran, but they did still love her. They took her back with them. She took them into consideration. She did still love them.\\n\\nThey all sat down and saw each other.\\n\\nThe other two sisters left, married. The king fell off a horse; the queen fell down a couple different times. The princess was alone. Then she met a roaring spirit of the river. She held her as she died with next to no regrets.
