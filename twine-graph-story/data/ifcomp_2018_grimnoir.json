A pair of ice cubes melt into a whiskey-filled glass, and smoke wisps up from my ashtray like the ghost of the past few hours. I've become a regular statue, leaning back in my chair with my shoe heels propped up on my desk. \n\n\tSolene's voice bubbles in from the other room, though I can't make out the words, just the sly tones of her business voice. I lower my fedora over my face and try to close my eyes.\n\n\tNo use. Restless. And bored.\n\n\tEventually I hear the signature //clack// of heels approaching, never quite as loud as it seems like they should be on these old oak floors, and I see Solene's frame blurred in the clouded glass of my office door. She swings the door open without a knock and slinks over to the desk. \n\n\tSolene's sleek and slender. She's usually dressed in a low-cut tight dress, the deep red of either wine or serious blood loss, depending on her mood. Today she's wearing black, matching the curly tresses that drape her shoulders. \n\n\t\"Cases for you, Morris,\" she says.\n\n\t\"Hm,\" I acknowledge. \n\n\tI can hear her leaning over the desk, and then my fedora is snatched from my face. I sigh.\n\n\tSolene stares flatly at me, and then shoots a disgusted look at my shoes on the desk. Golden, cat-slitted eyes broadcast her annoyance in my general direction.\n\n\t\"Asleep on the job, while I do all the work, huh?\" she says. \n\n \t\"Your eyes are showing,\" I tell her. \n \n \tHer eyes instantly cut to a rich brown, and she tosses a manilla folder at me. \n \n\t\"Murder and a theft,\" she says. \"And a man who insists on speaking to you in person.\"\n \n\tI take my feet down from my desk reluctantly and sit up, reaching for my glass. \n\n\t\"I hope this isn't another haunted house guy,\" I say. \n\n\t\"I'll let him up,\" Solene says, turning away from me and slipping back into the other room. \n\t\n[[Continue.|firstClient]]",

The door swings open, and a man enters. Sloppily dressed, sleepless eyes. No older than twenty-eight or twenty-nine, might be much younger--face screams hard drugs. \n\nHe shuffles awkwardly up to the desk and stands blankly in front of it until I gesture at the chair across from me. The man nods, takes a seat. \n\n\"S-so, you're Morris. They say you've never dropped a case.\"\n\n\"They're right.\"\n\nA moment of silence. The kid squirms in his seat in a way that reminds me inexplicably of an insect flipped on its back. Definitely younger, I think. Maybe twenty-two. \n\n\"My house is haunted,\" he says. \n\nFantastic. I open a drawer, lift the whiskey bottle. \n\n\"Might I direct you to a psychic? Priest, maybe? You got a favorite god?\"\n\nHis eyes turn hard, gain a surprising glint. \n\n\"Are you a fucking occult detective, or what?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" I say, unscrewing the cap. \"Means I solve murders. Assaults. Not spooky sounds in your house at night. Find someone else.\"\n\n\"It killed my girlfriend,\" the guy blurts. \"Everyone says she OD'd, but I know that's not what happened.\"\n\nHe sits there a moment, seeming rattled. I watch his face. Slowly, I open another drawer and pull out a second glass. I pour us both one hell of a shot, and hand him his. \n\nHe downs it and clutches the glass over his lap in both his hands, oddly gently, like the way a kid might hold a baby bird. \n\n\"You know ghosts don't normally kill people, right?\" I say. \n\nHe's looking past me. \n\n\"I know what I saw. I know there was something...in there. Wasn't new. But it was getting worse. And then...Listen, she'd gone clean. And I...I saw the thing that killed her in her sleep that night. I saw the eyes. Saw it leaning over her. There was a terrible smell...It was like I couldn't move. Thought I'd dreamed it. But when I woke up...she was dead.\"\n\n\"Any noticeble injuries? Might have to see the body myself, you realize,\" I tell him. \n\nHe nods stiffly. \"She had some tiny marks on her neck. That was it. She's already been...taken away, though.\" The morgue. Great, always fun. \n\n\"I don't work for free,\" I say. \n\nThe guy nods, or maybe a sharp twitch. \n\n\"Just figure this out. I owe her this much.\"\n\nSolene is already at the door; she always has the best sense of timing. She opens it and leads him out, and I can hear him walk past her, out of the offices and into the grim hallway outside. \n\nA spectral killer? My eyes fall onto the manilla folder, with two other cases inside. \n\nSeems my night just got a whole lot more interesting. \n{(set:$case1 to \"drugsmurder\")(set:$case1label to \"The Haunted Space\")(set:$case2 to \"songgarden\")(set:$case2label to \"The Song Garden\")(set:$case3 to \"dogmurder\")(set:$case3label to \"The Night Teeth\")}\n[[Continue.|office]]\n",

They may be more likely to manifest at night, however, to take advantage of the darkness in creating fear. \n\nPhantoms do not injure or kill and are thus considered relatively harmless--though a phantom's victim, after several sleepless nights, may disagree. If trapped in place and submerged in incense, they disintegrate. \n\n(link: \"Back.\")[(goto: $bookstate)]",

Large eyes adapted for darkness.\nWeakness: silver\nCategory: beast\n\nThe sigbin, when standing upright on its hind legs, comes up to about a human's chest in height. Sigbins have an exceptional sense of smell. They can scurry quickly on all fours.\n\nSigbins feed exclusively on blood. \n\nThey are opportunistic feeders, and much like rats, are adept at getting into human dwellings and nesting there. Sigbins may or may not drain their victims entirely. They typically feed only once every few months, and so a building infested with a sigbin may only notice occasional sounds of scurrying or movement most of the time.\n\nSigbins are fast and deft, but are more likely to avoid confrontation. They have a vicious bite when cornered. \n\n(link: \"Back.\")[(goto: $bookstate)]\n",

While legend holds that vampires cannot sustain exposure to sunlight, the truth that likely spurred the myth is that sunlight is quite disorienting to them, and may momentarily blind or stun them.\n\nVampires are excellent at stalking prey. They hunt at night, and typically drain humans of blood completely in order to be sated. A vampire must be stabbed through the heart with a silver knife or beheaded--otherwise, there's a good chance they will withstand their injuries and survive.\n\n(link: \"Back.\")[(goto: $bookstate)]",

This tome assists with the latter. \n\nNames are powerful. A monster can be instantly stunned if identified correctly by name. If its reason for existence--that which tethers it to the world--is named, it can be purified. Alternatively, and of more interest to hunters, they can be killed. \n\nUse this book. Learn their names. Learn their weaknesses. Learn their patterns. \n\nHunt well.\n\n-Solomon Reeve\n\n[[Back.|grimoire]]",

Its namesake rolls alongside the street a couple blocks over, I can hear it from here. \n\nAnd smell it. The river's a polluted mess. I can't imagine why people enjoy looking at it, but they certainly seem to: a park runs along a good portion of its length, a wide concrete walkway edging right up to the water, and while this area is mostly residential, many of the restaurants and businesses upstream have decks overlooking the water. \n\nRight now, the river's probably swollen with rain. \n\nI'm standing on the sidewalk in a residential area. Old two-story houses line my view, squeezed closer together then they build them these days. \n\n(if:$firstHouse is \"yes\")[ [[221 Fairview Street is just up ahead.|221fairview]] ](else:)[ [[221 Fairview Street is just up ahead.|221fairviewsecond]] ]\n\n<div id=\"menu\">\n[]<statlink|\n[]<stats|\n(replace: ?statlink)[(display: \"hideStats\")]\n</div>",

These days, he maintains his prior identity publically, pretending to be a human playboy--really, he's only faking the \"human\" part. Doesn't look a day over twenty-five, and never will. \n\nPretty harmless as far as monsters go, unless you happen to be challenging him to a vodka drinking contest. Feeds lightly on willing victims, of which there's apparently no shortage of in this city. He's a good-looking man, I'll give him that. Thick, dark hair, kind that looks really soft. Undeath made him a bit paler, but he hides it well in careful lighting. Eyes are subtle. You can get lost in them easily, noticing small shifts in hue. Stare in them long enough and you realize that the dark tones are actually unnatural shades of red. \n\nGrim and I have an agreement: he provides occassional consultation, and I keep his little secret between us. \n\nI head to his apartment in Highview, where he has a spacious loft that overlooks the city. He's fond of having parties on his roof. Has a great view, I'll admit.\n\nThe doorman knows me, lets me into the building. I try to ring his apartment. No luck. \n\nGuess second time's the charm.\n\n\"Morris?\" comes his voice through the speakers. He doesn't waste any time. \"Come on up.\"\n\n[[Continue.|grim2]]",

They are often found in the command of more powerful demons. \n\nConversation is unlikely to be easy with an imp, though if one has patience, one will find they can be easily deceived. The claws and fangs of a single imp are little threat, but in a pack they can be dangerous.\n\n(link: \"Back.\")[(goto: $bookstate)]",

Though they seem to be drawn to tragedy, the singing of an alkonost is blissfully sweet and mildly sedative. \n\nThey feed on fruits, seeds, and berries.\n\n(link: \"Back.\")[(goto: $bookstate)]",

Their song is beautiful and has a hypnotic effect, which allows prey to be easily caught. \n\nThey are predators, and will feed on large animals or, more occasionally, humans. Their talons are extremely sharp and dangerous, but their wings--with a span of 4 to 4.5 meters--can knock a man unconscious.\n\nTrapping or shooting them to ground them is an effective strategy.\n\n(link: \"Back.\")[(goto: $bookstate)]",

The harpy is an opportunistic creature. Harpies are largely scavengers, feeding on berries, seeds, and other creatures' kills. \n\nHarpies have a penchant for theft, as they are strangely attracted to shiny objects and will fill their nests with them. Harpies will generally only fight when cornered, but their talons are a serious threat. \n\n(link: \"Back.\")[(goto: $bookstate)]",

In fact, it is more likely to steal a human's lunch. \n\nThey are natural pranksters. Fond of warmth and high places, it is not uncommon for them to sneak into human establishments for free food, shelter, and their own entertainment. \n\nThey are quite stubborn but can sometimes be reasoned with and convinced to leave. If angered, a cat sidhe can seriously injure or kill a human. They sometimes prey on household pets. \n\n(link: \"Back.\")[(goto: $bookstate)]",

It is said that a bakeneko can reanimate a corpse by leaping over it, but there's no evidence for this claim. \n\nWhat is true, however, is that bakeneko are masters of creating illusions to defend themselves. They are insatiable hunters, and are not above eating humans, especially in urban areas. Bakeneko can charm humans into approaching them voluntarily.\n\nDue to the deceptive nature of their magic, utmost care should be taken when dealing with bakeneko. A protective talisman can help repel their abilities.\n\n(link: \"Back.\")[(goto: $bookstate)]",

The upstairs windows have a great view of the powerlines a few feet away swaying in the wind. Hard to say what color the door was originally meant to be. It's mostly a faded gray, flecked with peeling paint. \n \n Seems home renovation wasn't at the top of our young couple's list of hobbies. \n (set:$firstHouse to \"no\")\n I pick my way through a semi-overgrown yard. Noah is sitting hunched on the front steps in front of the door, smoking a cigarette. He seems cold, wet, and miserable. \n \n \"Wasn't sure if you'd be here,\" I comment, approaching the door. \n \n \"Haven't stayed here lately,\" he says. \"Haven't wanted to since. But I figured I should be here. Help you out. I dunno.\"\n \n \"Appreciated,\" I say. \n \n Actually, I'm glad he has no desire to come in. Makes my job easier. Can look through at my own pace, no one with an attachment to the scene to get in my way. \n \n \"Left the key with the chick in your office.

More commonly, they prefer a different sort of fluid altogether. \n\nTo this end, they can enshroud themselves in an illusion, making them appear as beautiful young women. The churel will use it to seduce an initially willing victim. Once in the churel's lair, it will discard the illusion and exhaust its victim until his death from either heart attack, dehydration, or starvation. \n\nThe churel's method of keeping a victim trapped is exhaustion of body and life force.

Lower crime rates. \n\nI follow my phone's directions till I get to the address: 15 Lark Circle. Must be the place. \n\nI park in the driveway of a spacious house. Modern Dutch colonial, two floors. Built, as with most homes in this part of Shade Hills, fairly recently. Well-groomed lawn and flowers out front. \n\nI approach the door. My finger's barely off the doorbell when a woman answers the door. I'd guess early thirties.\n(set:$metJayla to \"yes\")\n\"Jayla?\" I ask. \n\nShe nods. \"You must be Morris. Come on in.\" \n\nI follow her into a clean and tastefully-decorated home. There are framed photos on the wall. Jayla and friends, presumably. Jayla and people who look like they're her parents. Jayla holding hands with a woman at the beach--wife or girlfriend, she appears in several of them.\n\nShe leads me to a kitchen where a small TV plays a crime drama as something boils on the stove, and switches off the TV. \n\n\"Water? Coffee?\" she asks me. \"I'm brewing tea now. Grow it myself in the garden back there.\"\n\nI instinctively start to decline, but change my mind. Never had homegrown tea, and I'm curious, even if I don't expect much of a difference. \n\n\"So, you've been having some problems with theft?\" I ask. \"I need you to describe what happened.\"\n\nJayla nods. \n\n\"I only just moved in here three years ago. Before that, this was my parents' house. They had it built and lived in it the whole time--never had any problems. But then I get here, and, well.\" She cuts the heat the pot on the stove. \"Once I started keeping the doors closed and locked, nothing disappeared from the house. But anything out in the garden is fair game.\"\n\n\"Not that I doubt you, but thefts happen all the time,\" I say. \"What makes you think this is a job for me, and not, say, a cop?\"\n\n\"For one thing, I haven't seen it, but it happens so quickly...like, I could be on the opposite side of the garden, or maybe I just stepped inside for a minute. And I turn around, and just like that! It's gone. Sometimes I swear I could hear a rush of air, but never footsteps or anything.\"\n\nShe takes the pot from the stove and pours steaming tea into two mugs on the counter. \n\n\"It's also, just...the things that disappear make no sense. A lot of metal. Coins, two watering cans, a spade, some other garden implements. I take off bracelets and necklaces when I'm working in the garden. I leave them inside now, so much has gone missing. Sometimes other things. I've lost a book, a pair of glasses...there's no rhyme or reason. If it gets left out there, it will disappear.\"\n\n\"You've seen no footprints? Any evidence of animals?\"\n\n\"It's outdoors, there are animals. But I've never seen a squirrel or a finch steal a watering can,\" Jayla says. She sets our mugs down on the table and takes a seat across from me. \"Any person would have to climb the fence to get in and out. I've never seen anyone.\"\n\nI drink some of the tea in the mug I'm grasping. A fresh, green taste. Not bad. Not bitter.\n(set:$metJayla to \"yes\")\n\"That's not the strangest thing,\" Jayla says. \"At night sometimes, I hear singing. In the garden.\" She watches me closely, expecting me to laugh, or maybe react in surprise.\n\n\"What kind of singing?\" I say.\n\n\"A woman's voice. It's gorgeous. When I look outside, I never see anyone or anything standing around out there. Zoe thought I was losing my damn mind until she was staying over night when it happened and she heard it too.\" Jayla chuckles. \"She doesn't laugh at me now.\" \n\nI set my empty mug down on the table. \n\n\"Mind if I look around?\" \n\nJayla gestures broadly with a hand.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" she says. \"I won't get in your way. Let me know if you need me.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I say, standing.\n\n[[Continue.|shadehills]]\n{(set:$case2notes to $case2notes + (array:\"Jayla says odd things disappear frequently from the garden behind the house.

An inugami is created when a soul is driven to desperation, often by being chained in front a food source and starved, and killed, usually by beheading, at the moment of peak desperation. This tortured soul may become an inugami, which the occultists would immediately bind to their service. \n\nAn inguami's true form is a monstrous, bipedal doglike creature, not unlike a lycanthrope in shape and form. It can use an illusion to disguise itself as a normal dog when with its master in public. Inugami are deceptively clever, but do not typically remember their past lives. \n\nThey can be formidable to fight. Inugami that are not intentionally created are known to be more aggressive. It was not uncommon for an occultist to lose control of his or her inugami and be killed by it. The practice of creating them has of course been, thankfully, outlawed for many centuries. \n\n(link: \"Back.\")[(goto: $bookstate)]",

It's quiet down here, must be an odd time. Only a relative scattering of people waiting for the trains, engrossed in their phones, a book, a quiet conversation. \n\nWhen the train comes and the doors slide open, I take a seat in the near-empty car, and then the train jolts forward and carries us through the dark tunnels. \n\nWhen I emerge at the Fort Wallace station, I brace myself for the rain and spend a few minutes hailing a cab. Finally, the cab drive pulls over, and I pay and hop out. \n\nA squat row of townhouses on either side of the street. Must be the place, I guess. I pick out the door for 35, and approach it with a sharp rap on the door. A metal star...what do they call those? Barnstars?...affixed to her door rattles with each knock. \n\nI can hear shuffling inside, but no answer. \n\n\"Miss Wheeler? This is Detective Morris.\"\n\nI can hear the shuffling approach the door. It cracks open, and I'm greeted with the combined scent of cinnamon and vanilla. Roberta's an elderly woman, frail as a bird. Her eyes are red and puffy. \n\n\"Come in, come in, dear,\" she says. I follow. \n\nShe walks slowly, and so I get a good look of the inside of her townhouse while walking. Orderly, clean. Carefully decorated in a \"country\", rustic style--not at all my thing, but she's got a good sense for pairing things. Some framed photos of her family, but no evidence of anyone else living here with her. \n\nAh, photos of a man who must have been her husband. She's been living without him a while...so, not Charlie, then. \n\nWe get to her living room, and she gestures at a soft recliner, while she perches on a sofa. The living room's cozy. A large dog sleeps on the carpet, a saint bernard. It barely lifts an eye toward me when I enter. \n\n\"That's Bernice,\" Roberta says, following my gaze. \"She misses Charlie, too.\"\n\n\"This is a difficult topic, Miss Wheeler, but has Charlie's body already been taken to the morgue?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, dear,\" she says sadly. \"He's right out in the backyard. I just found him this morning. I mean to bury him today, but...I thought you might want to take a look at him.\" Her eyes get watery, but she holds herself together well.\n\n\"Uh...well, thank you,\" I say. The backyard...? \"I need to know as much as you can tell me. What was Charlie doing when it happened? I need you to describe last night as well as you can.\"\n\n\"Well, it was a typical night, as far as I know, at first,\" she says. \"I took Bernice and Charlie up to bed around ten or so, I watch a bit of television some nights, and then fall asleep. Well, around two in the morning or so, Bernice had to go out. Sometimes it happens. I took both of them out, waited by the backdoor, with the porchlight on, as always.\"\n\nShe trembles a little. \"Bernice came in first, and well, with all the rain, I dried her paws a little so she wouldn't track the mud all through the house. I had my back turned to the door for maybe a few minutes...but Charlie, out in the yard behind me, he makes the most awful growl, and then, a--a scream. And he was...\"\n\nShe grinds to a halt, fighting tears. So Charlie's a dog.\n\n\"Roberta,\" I say, trying for a gentleness that doesn't come naturally to me, \"I know this is hard, but I have to ask, what makes you sure it was paranormal? There are wild animals, sociopathic teens...\"\n\nRoberta shakes her head firmly, taking a tissue from the table beside her and blowing her nose. \n\n\"I //saw// it,\" she says. \"It was in the dark yard, but I saw it. Crouching over Charlie. I saw a flash of fangs reflecting the light back. It stood up and leaped clear over the fence. And Charlie...was...\"\n\nInteresting. \n\n\"Thank you, Roberta,\" I say, standing. \"I'll take a look at\"--\n\n\"You should also know,\" Roberta says quickly. Her eyes gain a surprisingly hard glint. \"This isn't isolated. There were a string of pet disappearances here lately. I wanted to believe it was just coincidence, people accidentally letting their dogs and cats out...I never thought it would happen to poor Charlie. He was such a good dog.\"\n\nHm. If this is has been multiple occurences, it's doubtful the culprit has any personal connection to Roberta. Probably no need to waste time investigating her place.\n\nSeems this townhouse complex has become something's hunting grounds. Time to find out what. \n\n\"Thanks,\" I say. \"I'm going to check out the backyard now.\"\n\nShe nods. \"I'll be here,\" she says. She picks up a remote and switches on the television. \n\n[[Continue.|eastshore2]]",

The spattered, sticky blood is stark against his white fur. \n\nSerious claw wounds on his back, dragging down into his left side, against his ribcage. Belly torn open, with clear evidence of feeding. Another wound to the face, on the muzzle, possibly defensive--a shallow scratch by comparison to the other wounds, likely inflicted when Charlie either bit the monster or attempted to. \n\nI take a quick glance up at the yard. That fence is no easy jump. A fleeing teenager could definitely make it, but...this doesn't look like human work. Hmm.\n\nRain continues falling on the body, washing gore down into the grass, making a bloody mess. There's a shallow square of grass upended beside me. Turning back toward the house, I see a shovel, still-damp with mud--apparently, the implement used to make it. I look at the half-dug hole. Even that little square must have been a lot of work for her.  \n\nI take the shovel, deepen the square, scoop Charlie's remains into the hole, and fill it. \n\nWell. Nothing left here. \n\n[[Back.|investigateyard]]\n\n{(set:$case3notes to $case3notes + (array:\"Seems pets are disappearing, and definitely getting eaten by something.\"))}\n\n",

This thing's getting sloppier, if anything. \n\nNot much going on as the sun takes its sweet time setting. An ant crawls onto my neck. I can hear chattering of birds in the nearby trees, soon to be quiet. \n\nI wait.\n\n[[Continue.|monsterappear]]",

I'm tempted to rest my eyes, but being fifteen feet up off the ground is good incentive not to. \n\nI've dimmed my phone's screen so that I can check the time without a surge of light up here in my hiding place. Late. I try to estimate how much longer I'll wait it out up here. \n\nBut...wait. Is that something approaching from two yards over? It's low to the ground, and in the dark, I can't tell if I'm imagining it. \n\nNo, the boxer hears it too. The dog lifts its head, ears perked up. The neighbor's fence gives the dark shape only momentary pause, and then it's in the adjacent yard. The dog begins to growl low and genuinely menacing. \n\nIt rises to its feet. The thing pulls itself over the fence and now it's in the dog's yard. \n\nAnd I'm up here in a tree. \n\nFuck. Gotta think fast. \n\nThe thing is hulking on two legs, with a loping gait. It nears the dog, lifts an arm...\n\n\"Hey!\" I yell, and the monster's head swivels to me instantly, a flash of eyes and teeth. In that second, the boxer in the yard clamps down on its nearest leg, tugs its head to the right. \n\nThe monster gives a whining snarl, kicking away the dog, and it's backing toward the front yard as I move to climb down the tree. I see it pull over the fence and flee toward the street, leaving the dog barking at the end of its chain. \n\nI scramble down the tree as quickly as I can in the dark feeling like the world's biggest squirrel. And dumbest. What the hell was I doing, forgetting to prepare anything to tag it with once I saw it?\n\nMaybe I'm getting old, I think as I run toward the street. \n\n[[Continue.|street]]",

The door in question is ajar, and I can see lights on inside. I draw my silver dagger and listen: not much. I shove the door open till it touches the wall, and edge my way inside. \n\nLights hastily switched on. The blood goes through the living room, heads to the kitchen. I'm not all the way in when I see it: the large shape on the ground. \n\nAs I approach the kitchen, the monster tears itself up off the floor with a snarl. Hurt.

I hate to admit that the place has kind of grown on me, maybe helped by the excellent food that sprang up close to my office. I guess it also appeals to me that it's not the kind of place where actual humans were displaced for these shops and coffee joints. It was only empty factory buildings before. These hipsters evicted only dust and ghosts. \n\nSeveral people out today, hurrying on the sidewalk. Rain hasn't deterred them much. I'm tempted by the warm scent of coffee, steaming up from the mug of a man seated at an outdoor table beside the sidewalk, his eyes fixed to his laptop. I pull myself away from the coffeeshop and keep walking. Marcus's apartment should be somewhere around here. \n\nI find the place that I hope is his, walk up to the door and pound on it. There's no panel to buzz his individual apartment. I wonder if I should check my case notes for his phone number. \n\nIt takes him a while to answer the phone. \n\n\"Marcus? I'm Detective Morris, here to speak with you. Outside your building, actually.\"\n\n\"I'll come let you in,\" Marcus says quickly, and then there's the sudden silence of an ended call. \n\nI hear scuffling coming to the door, and then I'm greeted by a thin young man. He has a short, well-maintained beard, lean body, sharp green eyes. Handsome man. Reminds me a bit of an ex. \n\n\"Come on up,\" he says. I follow him to his apartment.\n\n[[Continue.|marcusApt]]",

Last month, a woman went missing from right around here. I'm sure you saw it in the news. They found her dead in the river.

The river gleams far below, choppy waves reflecting city lights. There's a low concrete wall topped by a railing beside me, and tall, circular lamps on poles alongside the sidewalk give it a decent kind of ambience. \n\nIt's actually a pleasant walk, and the sidewalk here is a little less crowded. \n\nI can see Riverside Brew up ahead, a tall, square factory building repurposed for beer. It's a successful local enterprise. I can see people surging inside. Finding Helena in the bar might not be that easy of a task, I realize.\n\nBut as I approach, I notice a couple ahead: they've stopped on their way out of the bar, standing at the railing. They're facing the river, enjoying the scene, the man's arm around her. \n\nThe odds are against me, but...\n\nI get closer. The woman matches Helena's description from the case notes Marcus had filed with Solene: brunette, about four foot five, black leather purse. She's sharply dressed, complete with heels. The man is also well-dressed, dark hair. \n\n\"Excuse me,\" I say, approaching. They turn sharply. \n\nThe man's so handsome I almost feel my chest ache, a reaction I haven't felt since college. Dark hair. Warm brown eyes, unfortunately guarded and suspicious toward me.\n\n\"Are you Helena?\" I ask the woman, focusing pointedly on her. \n\n\"Who...are you?\" she says, frowning. \n\n\"Don't bother her,\" the man says. He seems spooked. \"Leave us the hell alone.\"\n\n\"She's a missing woman,\" I say. \"And that would make you a suspect. Step away from her now.\"\n\nI reach my hand into my coat, slowly, wrap my hand around the handle of my silver dagger. The man seems worried. He steps forward suddenly. \n\nThose warm brown eyes look me full in the face, and they look sad...it almost makes me hurt. I find my hand relaxing a little off the dagger. \n\n\"We don't have to do this,\" he says, reaching out with a hand. He rests it gently against my cheek. \n\nSomething in the back of my head is struggling, some nagging thought. It's irritating. Keeping me from enjoying the moment. \n\n\"Let her go,\" I'm struggling to say, surprising myself. Why do I want to say this? \"Or I'll...\"\n\nHe leans in and kisses me, and then regards me with a warm smile.\n\n\"You know what you should do?\" he whispers. \"You should jump into the river.

I knock on his door. \n\nMarcus answers it after a few minutes. \n(set:$marcusol to \"yes\")\n\"...Hello?\" he says. \n\n\"Hi, I'm Solene, Detective Morris's assistant,\" I say, shaking his hand. \"I'm here to follow-up. Mind if I come in?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" Marcus says, stepping inside to make room in the doorway for me. \n\nI look around. What could easily be a cramped apartment is cleverly furnished and decorated to maximize space, with a modern-simplistic style that I actually find quite appealing. \n\nIt's incredibly clean in here...almost creepily so. It would pass better as a staged showroom than a lived-in apartment, and yet the small signs of life are here: shoes in the rack by the door, something cooking on the stove, some spices and things (organized) on the countertop. \n\n\"Mind if I look around? It might help me find some clues about what's going on with Helena.\"\n\nMarcus doesn't seem crazy about the idea, but he nods, gesturing broadly with his hand. \n\n\"Go ahead,\" he says. \"I'll be here if you have any questions.\"\n\nHe returns to the kitchen. \n\n[[Continue.|marcusapt]]",

The cafe is warm and comfortable; I'd been considering an outdoor table, where street noise could mask the conversation a little and provide semi-privacy, but there's enough of a chatter in here for white noise. \n\nI walk up to the counter. A chalkboard lists probably fifty different coffee brews, with the image of a man in a yellow shirt getting pulled up in a beam of light in the center. That's not even how it worked, I think to myself. (Morris made me watch that show, too. I'm slowly being acclimated to human science fiction culture thanks to his singlehanded efforts, the nerd.)\n\nI order a coffee, and take a seat in a corner near the front of the store. It occurs to me that I have no idea what Jenny looks like. I don't think Marcus described me to her, either. I take out my notepad and a pen and set it on the table in front of me, and I resolve to keep my eyes peeled, keeping an eye on the door. \n\nEventually, I watch a young blonde woman enter. I make tentative eye contact with her, and she watches me carefully. She orders a coffee and waits for it. Then she slowly approaches. \n\n\"Detective Solene?\" she asks hesitantly. \n\nI nod. \"Take a seat,\" I say, gesturing. \n\n\"Marcus told me this is about Helena,\" she says. She looks down into the steam of her cup. \"I seen haven't her for a while either, to be honest. I can tell you that right now.\"\n\n\"You'd spent a lot of time with her before she disappeared,\" I say. \"You guys went out almost nightly, right?\"\n\n\"It wasn't nightly,\" she says, \"but it was pretty frequent. We do drink a lot, but I mean, we never //overdid// it, you know? We were still careful.\"\n\n\"I'm not actually here to talk about your drinking habits,\" I say, hopefully reassuringly. I don't want to put her on the defensive. I can tell she's holding back. \"Was Helena having a hard time lately? Is that why she'd been going out more?\"\n\nJenny nods. She folds her hands around her cup. \n\n\"She'd just been miserable. She wasn't happy with her job, with Marcus...\"\n\n\"With Marcus?\"\n\n\"Have you met him? He's a great guy, I don't mean anything against him, but...he's really precise. Helena called it obssessive. It never used to bother her, but it's like every little thing about him irritated her lately. Honestly, I think they just had nothing in common. They'd been married two years, and I think the realization that maybe she'd made a mistake was bumming her out.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I say. \"Jenny, this is important. Helena may be in danger.\" That catches her attention, even if I'm pretty sure it's a lie. Means and ends, right? \"Did you know she'd been spending time with a man lately? Do you know anything about him?\"\n\nJenny stares down at her coffee, struggling. She takes a long, intentional sip. Eventually the guilt wins out. \n\n\"You won't tell Marcus?\" she says. \n\n\"That's not what this is about,\" I say. \"I won't.\"\n\n\"We met David at a bar one night. God, he was...he's amazingly handsome. When he came up to Helena, giving her this sly grin...Amanda was pissed. I was happy for her. We were all keeping an eye on them--you know how it is with men in bars,\" she says. \"But they just talked. All night. He gave her his number. After that, they started spending more time together. David would join us when we went out at night.\"\n\n\"I felt pretty bad. That Marcus didn't know. It's the kind of thing Amanda would do, but it was kind of a first for Helena. But she was so much happier than she'd been...I couldn't bring myself to do anything,\" Jenny says. \n\n\"But you haven't seen or heard from them lately?\" I say. \n\n\"I think this is where David lives,\" she says, taking my notepad and scrawling an address. \"I gave Helena a ride there once. You might find them there. I haven't really tried to contact her, I didn't know...that anything was really wrong. I just figured...she was occupied, you know? I'd hear from her here and there and she seemed happy. Figured, maybe she didn't need to be going out with us anymore.\"\n\nJenny takes to staring into her cup again. \n\n\"Do you know anything else about David? A last name?\"\n\n\"Di...Dimakos? Something like that? I only heard it once, but the alliteration made it stand out.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Jenny,\" I say. I gather my notepad and pen. I want to check out David's apartment right away. \"I have to go now. Thank you for your time.\"\n\nShe nods. When I leave, she's still sitting there, on her side of the table.

It is fond of illusions, and can control dreams. It is unlikely to reveal its true form to a waking human, preferring sleeping victims whom it can manipulate through their dreams. If they do appear in physical form, they will cast illusions on themselves to alter their appearances; effectively, they are efficient shapechangers. Unlike incubi and succubi, l\u00fcd\u00e9rcek care little about the willingness of their victims. They will also drain their victims of energy entirely--sometimes this is steady and over time, if they have a favored victim, or it can happen in a single night. \n\nThey don't always kill, and can be unpredictable. There have been historic cases of l\u00fcd\u00e9rcek growing fond of victims and sparing them. Sometimes, they appear only to cause nightmares. \n\nThey are dangerous because of their cleverness, but fighting them can be disorienting--a l\u00fcd\u00e9rc can make it difficult to determine what is real.

It started out that we thought we have a serial murderer. And well, it seems we do...but we don't think he's human. Our efforts to locate and trap him proved useless. He's unnaturally elusive.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I say. \"Tell me more about the murders.\"\n\n\"At first we thought the pattern seemed consistent with a serial killer, as I said. Which is bad news, means the fed could step in and makes things more difficult for us. But its victims: men and women alike, death by either suffocation or strangulation. Sometimes evidence of sexual assault. Bodies always left in an obvious place overnight. A signature: this symbol, typically on a scrap of paper left in the victim's pocket. People have taken to calling this thing The Hierophant.\"\n\nGarcia hands me a note card with a copy of the symbol: a traditional triple cross, each bar longer than the bar above. At the bottom of the cross, on either side, two curving mirrored designs...antlers, maybe?\n\nHmm.\n\n\"That's all dark stuff, but it sounds pretty human so far,\" I say. \n\n\"That's what we thought too. Until we started investigating further. Trying to see if there was a pattern. The victims come from all over Steel City. One of the only things they had in common, turns out, was the onset of strange dreams, days to weeks before their deaths.\"\n\n\"What kind of strange dreams?\"\n\n\"Unpleasant ones, apparently. Spouses and friends reported being told about nightmares. The dreams were all over the place, sometimes nonsensical, but they tended to include the appearance of some malevolent entity. We've confirmed with family that in at least some of the cases, the victims were last seen sleepwalking out. They disappeared and weren't seen again until the body turned up. In many cases, they'd begun acting erratically prior to death.\"\n\n\"That does sound a little more in my arena,\" I admit. \"Strange pattern, though. Of the three classes of monsters, only cursed have the presence of mind for premeditated killing. Something like a vampire or werewolf might even enjoy the notoriety, but this isn't their style at all. There are demons, too, but they're much rarer to encounter.\"\n\n\"Look, I don't need the details. I don't know anything about this stuff,\" Garcia says, putting her cap on. \"But I thought I'd drop this case off with you, to see if you make any more headway than we currently are. At this point, we just want to bring this thing down, whatever the hell it is.\" \n\nShe walks to the door. \"Good luck, detective,\" she says. \"Let us know if you find anything.\"\n\nThen she leaves. \n\n\"Interesting case,\" Solene says. \n\n\"I'd say so.\" I look at the file in my hand. \"In fact, I think it deserves my unique attention.

It's the kind of place that it's hard to imagine something terrible happening inside. (if:$purified <= $killed)[The rain assumes a personal challenge to see how much it can drench my clothes before I reach the Harts' front door.]\n\nI walk to the door and knock. A very tired but otherwise fairly together-seeming woman answers. \n\n\"Hello?\" she says. \n\n\"Hi, Audrey Hart? I'm Detective Morris, with the investigation of your husband's death.\"\n\n\"Oh, hello. I admit I'm a little surprised. We already spoke with that other officer a few times,\" she says.\n\n\"That's right, I have Mueller's notes right here. I'm just here to ask a few additional questions, if that's all right.\"\n\n\"Come in.\"\n\nI follow Audrey into her house. Reasonably clean, but lived-in. Tastefully decorated. We walk into her living room and take a seat on opposite beige cloth sofas. \n\n\"My daughter Janet will be home from school in about an hour and a half. If it's possible to wrap this up before that, I'd really appreciate it.\"\n\n\"I understand completely. This won't take long,\" I say. I flip open the notes. \"Let's start with the dreams. You say Joey was having some strange dreams? When did that start?\"\n\n\"About a...a couple weeks or so before, I think,\" she says. \"I didn't really pay attention to it at first. He just seemed really tired a lot. But I noticed when it became a consistent thing, you know, and so I asked him about it. That's when he started telling me about the crazy dreams.\"\n\n\"What kinds of dreams did he tell you about?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. They were weird, usually disturbing. He...\" she frowns. \"He become convinced something was trying to use them to communicate with him. That some mystic was going to reveal the sacred truths of the world to him, or something really bizarre like that.\"\n\n\"Was this part of the erratic behavior you described?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Audrey says. \"He was...god, he was nearly delusional by the end. Not like himself at all. It was really hard to watch. And Janet...\" she shakes her head. \"The night he disappeared, I was asleep. We all were. I just...woke up the next morning, and he was gone. The front door was unlocked. He hadn't taken his keys. He just got up and walked out. He had to have. 'Turn off the bathroom light.'\" She laughs sadly. \"That was the last thing I ever said to him.\"\n\n\"I see. Thank you, Audrey.\" She's staring off into a corner. I feel like I should say something. \"I'm sorry for the loss of your husband.\"\n\n\"Just find this thing,\" she says quietly. \n\n\"One more question. Did Joey ever say anything that would give any hints about this thing's appearance? In his dreams, maybe?\"\n\n\"It took different forms,\" she says. \"He had a few dreams about a black dog. Sometimes a naked young woman.\" A subtle change of emotion, there--something that passes over her face quick. \"By the last several days, though, he'd taken to calling it the Horned Man.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I say. I stand up. \"I'll be leaving now.\"\n\nAudrey follows me to the door, and I leave her in the doorway. \n\n\"Take care,\" I tell her as I leave the house, and she gives a slight nod. \n\nShe remains in the doorway, and I see a schoolbus pull up as I'm starting my car. In the rearview mirror, a highschooler gets out and walks quickly up to Audrey, smiling and pointing to something on her phone. The change in Audrey is impressive: no hint of the quiet woman in the house several minutes ago. All wide smile and expression. She casts a hasty, nervous glance at my car that her daughter doesn't notice. \n\nI leave.\n\n[[Continue.|phonecall]]\n",

We walk back into the foyer. \n\n\"Logan's wife called us because she'd been reading the reports of the murders and got scared. Says he's been acting strangely too,\" she says. \n\n\"Have you learned anything?\"\n\n\"No,\" she shakes her head. \"He speaks in mystic bullshit.

Great. \n\nThe dim, orange flourescent lights in the ceiling cast odd shadows in here. The lot curves, sloping downward around the bend to the next level below.

I follow the cue with my flashlight...to the sloping floor leading down to the third level. \n\nMy phone buzzes suddenly, startling me. \n\n\"Morris,\" says Garcia. Her voice is slightly muffled with static. \"I apologize for the delay. My guys were investigating a tip along the way that he might've darted through an alley. They're checking it out.\"\n\n\"No need,\" I say. \"I found him. He's dead.\"\n\n\"Oh, no. Shit.\"\n\n\"I think it's in here,\" I say. A wave of static is overcoming the call. \n\n\"Morris? You're breaking up.\"\n\n\"Garcia? Hey.\"\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\nThen dead silence. Dropped call. I look at my phone. No service. \n\nI look at the gaping dark of B3F. I walk over.\n\n[[Continue.|hierophantencounter]]\n<audio src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/5thydx2q5xkaxh3/351417__kinoton__dark-horror-drone.mp3?dl=1&m=\" autoplay loop> ",

However, it is now understood that they are one and the same, and can appear in a small variety of different color morphs, for reasons that remain unknown.\n\nAcross cultures, the chat d'argent is associated with good fortune and prosperity. They can be tamed and trained as much as any material cat can.  Their unique ability to disappear and reappear in a new location may have made them useful trained thieves. Alternatively, they were simply seen as good luck because of their relative benevolence, keeping other pest monsters away from the vicinity that they claim as their territory. \n\nAs their behavior is essentially that of an especially clever domestic cat, a chat d'argent's negative impact on humans is likely to amount to little more than missing scraps of food. In fact, humans who encounter them often assume they have simply seen a very strange-looking cat.\n\n(link: \"Back.\")[(goto: $bookstate)]\n",

The Jersey devil is an ambush predator, known to emit a piercing scream both defensively and to startle prey. \n\nThey greatly prefer broad forests in mostly colder climes, and will actively travel out of more urban areas to seek their preferred habitat. Though their environment makes encounters with humans relatively less likely, those who travel through such forests should be wary: they have been seen killing and eating creatures as large as horses, and of course, humans, with no difficulty. \n\n(link: \"Back.\")[(goto: $bookstate)]",

I wander the fourth floor until I find an office that seems like the location of 427 Clemont Hall. A professor's office. I walk over and knock on the door. \n\n\"Miss Ma\u015blanka?\" I say. \"Uh, Dr. Ma\u015blanka, rather. I'm Morris. You spoke with my assistant on the phone.\"\n\n\"Oh, come on in, and take a seat,\" she says. \"Just Patricia's fine.\"\n\nI follow her suggestion and sit, feeling a little uncomfortably like a student, in the chair across from her desk. \n\n\"Patricia, what seems to be the problem?\"\n\n\"Is this the detective?\" says a man quietly, peering in the doorway. \n\nShe nods. He enters. \n\n\"Stephen, can you close the door?\" Patricia says. \n\n\"There's something here, on the fourth floor,\" Stephen says, once the door's closed behind him. \n\n\"We're hiring you more or less off the books. Keeping it from the department chair. To be honest, we don't think he believes us,\" Patricia says. \n\n\"But several people in our department pitched in,\" Stephen says. \"Honestly, everyone on this floor knows it's here.\"\n\n\"Uh, well,\" I look from Stephen to Patricia. \"What kinds of things have you been experiencing?\"\n\n\"Odd sounds, especially when you're alone. Shadows darting behind things. Food goes missing from the breakroom fridge,\" Stephen says. \n\n\"Uh, I'm not sure that's...\"\n\n\"You don't understand, it happens even overnight. And the janitors don't have a key. There's not really a good explanation for it.\"\n\n\"It's just quietly understood that you don't work here late at night,\" Patricia says. \"Not by yourself. If you do, you feel it: it's up here with you. And sometimes you see it, in the corner of your vision.\"\n\n\"The newest hire to the department, James, didn't know about any of this. But he recently told me he sometimes hears things falling over in Richard's old office next door. That office is locked and unused, Detective Morris,\" Patricia adds. \n\n\"I...see,\" I say, closing my notebook. \"Well, I guess I'll take a look around, see what I find.\"\n\nStephen nods. \"This late in the day, there won't be many students up here. People start will start to trickle out and go home. Like we said, no one likes to work late in here.\"\n\n\"I'll stick around in case you need any help,\" Patricia says. \n\nI shake my head. \n\n\"You can wait elsewhere in the building, if you'd like,\" I say, \"but to properly conduct an investigation, I need everyone out of the way. No offense.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Patricia says, \"I guess I can do that. I'll hand you the keys on my way out...please be careful with those,\" she says, in a warning tone.\n(set:$talkedFaculty to \"yes\")\n\"Won't betray your trust,\" I say. \"Just part of the job.\"\n\n\"Give me a few minutes,\" Patricia says. \"Then I'll be out of your way.\"\n\nStephen walks over to his own office nearby.\n\nI find a chair in the common space outside of Patricia's office, and wait.\n\n[[Continue.|universityoffice]]\n{(set:$case3notes to $case3notes + (array:\"The clients, a group of faculty members at Steel City University, insist that the fourth floor of their building is haunted by something.

Though their coats can be a variety of colors, their eyes are always red. \n\nThough wargs are not as dangerous as some other monsters and lack sentience, they do have animal cunning, and much like real wolves, can inflict fatal injuries. \n\nUniquely among monsters, wargs have been observed seeking company with living wolves (and in one recorded and notable instance, other wargs; see Notre Dame Incident of 1450). It is unknown how wargs gain acceptance by wolves, but wolf packs led by wargs can be a serious threat: they abandon their typical behavior in favor of reckless and aggression, and become fearless of humans.\n\n(link: \"Back.\")[(goto: $bookstate)]",

If addressed, they tend to gently laugh or giggle, but will make no coherent reply. When a person approaches one, it will turn around and reveal its face: a horse's skull. Legend holds that the victim will immediately die of fright. \n\nHowever, the true level of danger posed by a siguanaba is disputed. While there are cases of fatal heart attacks suffered by siguanaba victims, most people survive the encounter just fine, if quite rattled. \n\nSiguanaba will laugh and disappear immediately after the encounter, only to reappear soon nearby to startle another victim. Their motivations are unknown, and even their level of intellect is unclear: while thought to be humanlike, they may well be operating on base instinct alone.\n\n(link: \"Back.\")[(goto: $bookstate)]",

Then, \"I won't hurt you if you don't make me.\"\n\n\"Who said anything about getting hurt?\" she says. \n\nShe places her hands on my chest and unfastens my coat, and then slides her hands along my waist. As I move to stop her, her hand brushes against the hilt of my dagger, and she freezes.

Any dwelling or structure that a domovoi considers its territory is guarded by its watchful eye. Domovye will drive out or kill encroaching spirits or other monsters, and they are known to be protective of their humans. They rarely make an appearance to the living people in their territory, though brief glimpses and unaccounted for sounds are more common. An exception appears to be children: anecdotes abound of children playing with and encountering these creatures in their homes, with whom the domovye tend to have a paternal relationship. \n\nDomovye are known sometimes to cause minor trouble, like causing phantom sounds or knocking things off shelves, when dissatisfied with the family in their home for a particular reason, such as perceived slovenlyness. More rarely, a domovoi will have difficulty accepting a new family if a house changes hands, and they become a persistent nuisance, though bodily harm does not extend beyond a pinch or bruise, and they will continue to defend the dwelling from other monsters. In some cultures, such as Russian and Czech, they are referred to as \"grandfather.\"\n\n(link: \"Back.\")[(goto: $bookstate)]",

I hope this kid is fairly together at the moment. Clem has every right to be coming apart right now, but I don't know how well I can deal with another hysterical person. I brace myself for sobbing on the other end. The dial tone cuts out.\n\n\"Detective Morris?\"\n(set:$metdaisy to \"yes\")\nHer voice is even. I must have hesitated a moment, because she adds, \"Clem texted me that you were coming. Where are you? I'll come meet you.\"\n\n\"Main Quad, I think. In front of Weyer Hall.\"\n\n\"I'll be right there.\" She hangs up.\n\nWell, all right. \n\nI'm crouching over the damp concrete, a cigarette in my teeth, studiously observing a bruise-purple earthworm ooze across the sidewalk, when I notice two legs approach and stop in front of me. \n\nI stand.\n\n\"Daisy, I'm assuming.\"\n\n\"Detective Morris. You're Clem's friend,\" she says, and I get the feeling she's discreetly sizing me up.\n\nShe's average height, a little over average build. Deeply clever, shining, bird-bright eyes.   \n\n\"I gotta admit, you're not as shaken up as I would've expected.\"\n\n\"I'm worried as hell,\" Daisy says, and it doesn't sound ungenuine. \"But fixating on it accomplishes nothing.\"\n\n\"Then let's get right to business. Why haven't you taken this to the cops?\"\n\n\"It's not an issue for cops,\" Daisy says. \"I got wind that yesterday he was heard talking about some long-haired woman.\"\n\n\"So that explains your ambivalence.\"\n\n\"It's not like that. Grant is...not always the sharpest tool in the shed, but he's got a good heart. He's an honest guy. I know there's more going on.\" \n\n\"There may be, but it still sounds to me like he could be in a very human kind of danger.\"\n\n\"Grant had taken up an interest lately with his buddies in ghost hunting,\" Daisy says. \"It started right before he started acting strangely and ultimately disappeared.\"\n\n\"That's not much to go on. It could purely be coincidence.\"\n\n\"It could,\" she agrees, \"but I really have the feeling it's not. Grant had taken to exploring weird places to try to find ghosts. I think they found more than they bargained for somewhere.\" She pauses. \"More specifically, Grant had been acting erratically the day before. He hadn't returned my calls, but some other people recognized him on campus. They said he seemed in a daze. Talking about the woman.\"\n\nFor a moment, I think about Garcia telling me about the Hierophant in my office, and my insides tighten. \n\n\"I should talk to them.\"\n\n\"I thought so. I've already arranged for us to meet with them in the rec room in Hemlock,\" Daisy says. She turns to walk away, one hand tightened on a backpack strap. \"Let's go.\"\n\nI almost start to thoughtlessly take a step to follow. \n\n\"No. No way, kid.\"\n\n\"I'm coming with you,\" Daisy says. \"I'm going to see this through, too.\"\n\n\"No way in hell. Clients and witnesses don't join the investigation. This isn't a fucking game, kid.\"\n\n\"So then let's quit wasting time,\" she says, her eyes shining coldly. She pauses, then turns and opens her backpack meaningfully, so that I can see what's inside. \n\nA glint of metal--my hand instinctively moves toward my dagger, as I wonder if I'm being threatened--but then I see a very familiar leather book. \n\nNo way. \n\nShe's glaring at me impatiently, after zipping it back up and slinging the backpack across her shoulder again. \n\n\"Fine,\" I sigh. \"Let's go talk. But I'm doing the talking.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" she says. \n\n[[Continue.|stmartin]]\n",

Tubes and wires line the walls, and wide HVAC piping lurks against the close ceiling. I can hear the thrumming of machinery, and likely somewhere, the boiler. We're in the beating heart of an active building.\n\n\"No sign of anything yet,\" Daisy ventures to whisper after we've crept forward a while. \n\n\"Hm,\" I acknowledge. She's right. Not so much as a ghost, so far. \n\nWe pass a doorway, minus a door. I shine my light inside. A massive boiler in the corner, locked behind metal chainlink barrier, sealed with a padlock.

After a while, guided by the phone in my hand, we reach the point, fairly far into the forest trail, that I marked on my phone's map. \n\nI look around. Tall evergreens stand around us, and birds, a whole chorus of them, calling out into the afternoon. It's shaded here, with all the tall trees. I know how close we are to campus, and yet it feels like a whole other world in here already. \n\nDaisy and I exchange a glance, but neither of us wants to say anything first, I think. She gives in pretty soon. \n\n\"Did he give us a name? Or say anything, actually, about who this person is?

That was...very long ago.\"\n\n\"You're still here,\" Daisy pointed out. \n\n\"Yes,\" she says, with a note of bitterness.\n\n\"Listen,\" I say, \"Virgil thought you could help us.

I roll it off of my chest and sit up. Its head lies sideways, a golden-brown eye glaring up at me. As quick as a bird, Daisy leans over, a silver dagger in her hand, lifts the kitsune's head, and slices its throat with one clean cut. \n\nIt gasps, and disintegrates into ash, falling into a small mound beside my legs. \n\n\"You good?\" Daisy says. \n\nI nod, and stand. \n\n\"See?
