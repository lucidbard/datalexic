His eyes were splendid, wide, fearless, as free from suspicion as a child\u2019s who has never been rebuked. His interest was more that of an intent girl playing a fascinating game than of a boy lured by gold.\n\nThe others moved a bit farther out, holding firmly, watching. Terry\u2019s smile was irreproachable, but I did not like the look in her eyes \u2014 it was like a creature about to spring.
