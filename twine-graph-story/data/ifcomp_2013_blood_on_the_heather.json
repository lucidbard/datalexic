He drums his fingers on the steering wheel and stares thoughtfully down the road.\\n\\nIn the grey predawn light, you can just make out the single tower and blocky grey main building of  castle peeking up over the forest that covers the hills alongside Loch Nathair.\\n\\n\"There it is.  Cailleach Castle.  Where the hag lives.\"  \\n\\n\"I didn't think it would be so small,\" you drawl out, crumpling up your soda can.  You throw it behind you.  It bounces off one of the vamp's heads.\\n\\nThey hiss, but it's half-hearted.  They'd kept going berserk at the smell of blood in such short quarters, kept trying to bite each other.  About half an hour ago Ralon had stopped at a car wash a couple towns back and ordered them to stand through a cycle.  They cleaned up, but apparently even the half-undead find it miserable to be huddled up, soaking wet.  At least they weren't as active as before.\\n\\n\"Heh.  The family that humans believe owns it couldn't afford to restore much.  They live in this section by the road.  Most of the castle is in ruins on that hill overlooking the loch.   It 'burned down' in the eighteen hundreds.\"\\n\\n\"What's with the air quotes?\"\\n\\n\"Humans say there was a fire ... vampires know that my Maker pissed off her witch allies, and there was a magical battle that destroyed the place.  Except for the crypts where She lives.\"\\n\\n\"Magic.  Evil spells and stuff?\"\\n\\n\"Dark wards, spectral guards, that kind of stuff.  Fucking witches, always with their hidden fees.\"  He licks his lips nervously.  \"Getting in won't be easy.\"\\n\\n\"Something tells me we can't just walk through the front door and ask for her.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah.  Forget about the castle, the woods, the tour groups.  She lives in the crypts deep under the castle.   That's where we gotta go.  As far as I know, there's two ways in.  There owners turned their section of the dungeons into a wine cellar ... there was a secret entrance to the crypts in there.  We just have to break into the building.  But my Maker watches out for her territory so she may have wards up everywhere.\"\\n\\n\"The other way in?\"\\n\\n\"There's a well in one of the gardens ... or is it the hedge maze?  Anyway, it's on the official tour.  Unfortunately there's a birdwatcher's tour group that comes through Saturday mornings ...\"  A bus drives by and makes the turn toward the castle.  \"And there they are.  Normally I wouldn't have a problem just carving my way through these sheeple, but my Maker hates when her prey get scared off and I gotta stay on her good side.  For now.  Okay, we'll go in through the manor.\"\\n\\nHe tools down the road.\\n\\n\"You know an awful lot about this place ... do you spend a lot of time with your maker?\"\\n\\n\"HA!  Fuck no!  But when I heard Matthias had come back here I dropped by the village to keep the place under surveillance in case he tried to cosy up to our maker, turn her against me.  Then I saw that article in the papers about that fucking dagger, and I knew he had a different game in mind.\"\\n\\nHe parks  in the lot, pays the sleepy eyed attendant with some red-stained cash, and heads for the owner's private drive, which is around the side of the twelve foot privacy wall that encircles the manor.\\n\\n[[F2]]\\n\\nLooks like you're stuck with Ralon the superstrong vampire and his bloodthirsty minions.

The second one goes down the same way.\\n\\nThe vamps surge against the gate, hissing eagerly, wrestling with each other and stepping on each other in their haste to obey their maker.

You're in the ill-fitting maid uniform, Ralon's wearing a 'shirt' he made by tearing neck and arm holes in a pillowcase, so people would stop pointing and staring at the bandages in his chest, and the six vampires are in various combinations of wet, scuffed leather and wet, badly ripped concert tees.\\n\\n\"Wonderful,\" he said.  \"We've been expecting you.

A teenaged girl with a pair of huge, thick granny-style glasses is banging enthusiastically on the piano, bent almost double over the keys.  You're not sure if it's a classical piece or some really unfortunate jazz.  A teenaged boy in a crumpled, wine-splashed suit is sitting at the couch, back to the window, nodding along to that sorry excuse for music.

What's he got to worry about?\\n\\nOne thing you do know is, things tend to get messy when Ralon flies off the handle.

You should duck back but you're staring, frozen in horrified fascination.  The guard opens his mouth, grinning wide like a snake about to devour bigger prey ... and his teeth change.  Two long, gleaming fangs drop into view and you know for sure you aren't tripping because you went with Danny, not Misha, and Danny doesn't slip drugs into your coke for fun.\\n\\nSince you know you aren't hallucinating, it can only follow that this is a vampire.  And it's spotted you.\\n\\nA young woman in sky high stilettos and a glittery sequined minidress scrambles into the room from the stairwell.   Screaming.  Her blonde hair is coming down from a french twist, and she's got blood spattered across her face and bony chest.\\n\\nShe stumbles into the room, off balance because one of her stilettoes has a broken heel, and falls to her knees.  The vampire guard whips around and rushes for her.  She screams again and kicks out, but he is too fast, too strong.  He lifts her and slams her into the floor and the screaming stops.  \\n\\nYou cover your mouth and swallow back down the energy drink you chugged on the way here.  You can clearly hear your fast gasping and the wet sounds as the vampire tears into that woman.\\n\\nHe'll finish with her soon, and you are a happy meal sitting all unguarded and alone in this room.  You need to get out of here!  Oh goody, there's the emergency exit.  You run over to it.    \\n\\nWhat th- it's locked?!  This is a shocking violation of fire codes!  You're going to give customer service an earful, assuming you or anyone else in this building survives!\\n\\nLooks like the only way out is through the room with the vampire in it.  You'd better find something to arm yourself with, fast.  But what to look for?\\n\\n[[B9]]\\nThat dagger can make people explode, so maybe the other things in the exhibit will, too.\\n\\n[[B10]]\\nOn the other hand, a stake is traditional in these situations (or so the 1001 schlocky vampire movies you've seen would claim).  Maybe you should look for one of them?  \\n",

Two vampires are there, savagely tearing into ... someone in a badly ripped suit.  You don't look too closely.  The vampires look up at Matthias on the stairs and lunge for him.  \\n\\nYou grab Matthias by the ankle - it would be a fucking tragedy if the dagger fell into the wrong hands, meaning anyone's hands but your own!  But you're a short, slim girl and you just don't have the upper body strength to drag him way.  \\n\\nShoulda joined Misha at the exercise center, but boxing's not your thing ...\\n\\nYou back off, not wanting to see Matthias get eaten but not wanting to lose sight of what happened to that dagger.  \\n\\nFlips backwards into a crouch and stabs the nearest vampire through an eye.  The vamp sucks in a shocked breath and SSSSSSSWHOOOOOOSHHHHH!  Gone in a puff of smoke.\\n\\nYou'll have to keep that in mind.  Matthias plays dirty, plays dead.  You like that in a man.\\n\\nThe other vampire hisses, eyes wide and crazed, and runs upstairs.  You notice someone has scratched its face, and something like black pus is dripping from the wounds.  Matthias chases after it and throws it into a glass display case.\\n\\nYou see a blonde girl in a sequined dress and stilettoes run up the stairs, a female vampire with bleached blonde hair teased high chasing close behind.    The vamp grabs her as she runs by and sinks its fangs into her thigh.  She shrieks, kicks it in the goodies and the vamp tumbles down the stairs to the bottom.  The blonde limps toward you with a broken heel to her shoe.\\n\\n\"Come on.\"  You offer her a hand.  She punches you in the teeth - good thing she wasn't wearing rings! - and shoves you aside as she rushes into the first of the upper exhibit rooms.\\n\\nYou see a vamp climb up the outer wall and vault, silently, over the balcony.  If your lip wasn't freshly split, you might have felt like warning her.\\n\\nYou turn your back on the cut-off screams and wet chewing noises.\\n\\nMatthias has grabbed the other vampire by the throat and grinds him into the shattered glass case.  \"Where is your master's lair?  Tell me, you pestilent creature, and I will end your suffering.\"  \\n\\nNo answer.  Matthias snarls even more deeply.  \"I've heard the rot is agony.  Maybe you think you can't suffer more, but I assure you, I am inventive.\"\\n\\nLet's see, one vamp here feeding off a bitch (though the blonde is so bony you doubt she has much blood to drink), and one vigilante with a magic knife.  That sounds like your cue to leave.  You look down the stairwell and see the blonde vamp is coming up it with a friend.  The new one has honest to god spiked piercings coming from his eyebrows, and a snake tattooed on his face.  He's got a crossbow, maybe from one of the exhibits downstairs, and it looks like he's loading a bolt.\\n\\n\\n[[B11]]\\nShould you warn Matthias to hurry up and take care of business?\\n\\n[[B12]]\\nOr should you sell Matthias out to these vamps and sneak off while they rip him up?\\n",

Luckily most of that past happened before you could be tried as an adult!  There's no reason to be nervous!\\n\\nIt's a beautiful place, marble walls and steel beams holding up the roof, statuary set here and there.  There is one long entrance hall, with tickets by the front door that leads to the street, and a gift shop by the door to the parking lot.  You the hallway stretches all two floors up to the roof and you can see the open balconies of the upper floor from where you stand.\\n\\nWell, now you've finished casing the joint - no, admiring the architecture - while your credit card is processed.  You step away form the girl at the ticket counter, putting the little sticker that proves you paid for entrance on the front of your nondescript white blazer (reversible, flower-patterned inside), which coordinates with a pale grey sheath and dark grey flats.  In your purse you have a tightly wadded long skirt and a pair of big flashy yellow sunglasses.  Just in case you feel the need to have another identity with little warning.\\n\\nSo, you take a programme from the man by the ticket counter and glance through it.  First floor, jewelry, looks interesting.  Oh, they have a rare earths exhibit, how natural history!  However, the meteorite would be worth a fair amount to the right collector.\\n\\nBla bla paintings, a Renoir, interesting, bla bla sculptures- there!  The 'Roman treasures' exhibit is up on the second floor.  You've got to get a look at this.  There's a lot of people here, which could be an advantage to distract suspicion from you ...  \\n\\nYou peek over the edge of the programme at the guards.  There are a lot of them milling around the place.  Maybe you should keep your plans modest, just enjoy the buffet that's down the hall and keep a low profile.  No need to burn the candle at both ends, you have two weeks here before flying back.\\n\\nHm.  You look closer.  There are ... a whole lot.  A dozen?  Twelve security guards that just came in by the service entrance.  They look pretty rough, too.  More tattoos than you're used to seeing on the gainfully employed.  Maybe it's a Scottish thing?\\n\\nMaybe something else is going on.\\n\\nYour phone buzzes.  It's a text from Danny.  It says: SAW DRUID EXHIBIT.  WHAT AN OUTRAGE.  HAD TO TRACK DOWN PROVISIONS.  FIND ME, FIRST FLOOR.\\nDanny in an outrage is about the most entertainment you have without paying for it ... on the other hand you see something interesting stirring upstairs; people are wandering out and it looks like someone's setting up a security rope.  \\n\\n[[B2]]\\nTrack Danny down, and enjoy the fireworks?\\n\\n[[B3]]\\nSurely one little peek at what's going on upstairs won't hurt ...\\n",

      "text": "You head down the hall.  There on your left is the gift shop.  It's separated from the rest of the museum by a wall of full-length windows, and you peek in as you walk by.  It seems full of kitschy crap, with customers edging sideways among the overstuffed tables and display shelves.  You spot books, candlesticks, keychains, 'genuine Highland tartans' in pink and teal, and what looks like a whole lot of secondhand Egyptian memorabilia.  Weird.  \\n\\nAh.  You smell food!  You hurry on and elbow people out of your way to get to the buffet table.  Eagerly you seize a paper plate and see...\\n\\nWhat the hell is this sorry excuse for a spread?  Dry squares of toast?  Tomatoes, cut in half and fried on the cut sides?  That's ... bizarre.  There's some sausage so at least that looks edible.  A stack of battered and deep fried sandwiches - you hurry on.  Kebabs on skewers ... you grab a couple, add some potato chips to your plate and a single slightly bruised apple, and squint at a sinister dark brown lump that vaguely resembles fruitcake.\\n\\n\"It's black pudding,\" Danny says behind you.  He's wearing a casual suit, bow tie, and pocket protector with several pens and pencils.  He's holding two styrofoam cups of some kind of fruit punch.\\n\\n\"Ohhhh man.  I didn't think that was real, like a real thing that people still eat nowadays.\"\\n\\n\"It gets worse.\"  Danny leans closer and whispers, \"There was haggis, but people cleaned that up fast.  I mean, it was gone within a minute of hitting the table.\"\\n\"Did you try some?\"  \\n\\n\"I feel sick.\"  He passes you one of the cups, takes a swig off his, and shudders.  \"I am sickened,\" his voice rises, \"and outraged by the condition of the druid exhibition display!\"  He pulls a small flask from one of his suit coat's inner pockets and doctors up your glass, then his own.  \\n\"What have they done?\"\\n\\nHe scowls at the punch and tosses it aside.  It sprays a large woman in a tight white dress.  She gasps and makes a beeline for security.  \"These cheap bastards are keeping the druid exhibit, which includes delicate textiles, wooden carvings, and even pieces of vellum - in an argon-infused atmosphere in the case!  Not helium!  Cutting corners like that will degrade the materials in no time, but do they care?  Apparently not!\"  He pulls out his flask again and chugs straight from it.  \"It gets worse!  I was looking at that sacrificial dagger - you know, the gorgeous one?\"\\n\\n\"Um, let me see ... yes, I think I remember seeing it when  I glanced at the catalogue.\"  You take the flask from him.  It won't do to let him get too worked up this early in the evening, not when you have plans you'd love to pull off.\\n\\nOf to the side, you see the security shove the woman in the stained dress aside, brusquely.  She turns her nose up and storms away.  That's some great customer service in action.\\n\\n\"Well, I got a closer look at it, due to them keeping the lights so bright in there, and that radiation is no good for the artifacts either.  And I saw ...\"  his voice drops, \"fingerprints.  Fingerprints!  Who the hell handled that thing?  Who would leave their body oils on it, etching away that gorgeous relic like acid?\"\\n\\n\"Oh no.\"  He's a man on the edge, and you know it would only take one more little nudge to push him over.  \"That's awful, but what can we do?\"\\n\\nDanny flails, sputtering.  \"What - what can we do?  You're asking me this?  You're actually saying that, just dismissing everything?!  I'll tell you what we can do.\"  He looks around wildly, ruffles his hair (he looks a little like Einstein at this point), and slowly turns to stare up the galley, up at the second floor.  \"We're going to give those artifacts a new home.  Yes,\" he muses.  \"We can take much better care of them.  You and I can slip away with them, just like the old days ...\"\\n\\nBingo.  You smirk, satisfied.  Danny is dependable, if not always predictable.  \"You still remember our old routines?  I think we can pull off a 'monkey in the subway' here, no problem.\"\\nHe taps his chin.  \"But where will we get so many balloons, at this time of night?\"\\n\\nYou shrug.  \"Condom machine in the men's room?\"\\n\\n\"Brilliant.\"  Danny hurries into the men's room.  \\n\\nYou hear someone scream.  It seems to be coming from the ... security entrance?  Then two more people screaming.  You aren't tall enough to see over people's heads.\\n\\nIn the men's room, you hear Danny shout in fear, and the sound of something smashing.\\n\\n[[B4]]\\nAre you going to look for something to arm yourself with, and then bust into the men's room to help Danny?\\n\\n[[B5]]\\nOr maybe you think there's no time to waste, so you'll go in the men's room now and improvise when you see what you're dealing with?\\n\\n",

Something' about checking th'  humidity levels.\"\\n\\n\"I'm just going to take one little peek,\" you promise him.  \\n\\nYou make your way up to the top of the stairs and step into the second floor.  The lights here are dimmer and set into the wall with diffuser panels of frosted glass in front.  It makes each large exhibit room look cavernous, shadowy in the middle with golden glowing walls.\\n\\nYou walk by the few stragglers in the first room and peer into the doorway of the second.  Someone's blocked the way off with a velvet rope between two moveable poles.  Aww, they even hung a 'no entry' sign.  That's cute.  Even cuter that everybody's obeying it!  \\n\\nYou look over your shoulder.  Not a security guard in sight.  As soon as the woman in buttoned fur coat (who has obviously smuggled in her teacup sized dog, it keeps yipping) turns her back, you climb over the rope and slip out of sight of the doorway.\\n\\nThis room has big glassed-in exhibit boxes lining the walls, and several freestanding ones in the center of the room.  You walk by the box of jewelry, taken from Viking burials from one of the many, many times the Scandinavians landed in Scotland and got their rape, pillage, and burn on.  \\n\\nNot in modern times, of course ...\\n\\nIt's disappointing to think that you haven't brought the right equipment for a job like this, but you can at least get a look at the famous druid artifacts, right?\\n\\nSMASH.\\n\\nYou freeze and listen to the sound of glass tinkling to the floor.  That's weird, shouldn't the alarms be going off?\\n\\nCuriosity gets the better of you, and you sneak forward.\\n\\n\"I can hear you,\" a man says.\\n\\nYou see a guy standing there in a long tweed coat.  He's slim, you can tell even the bulk of that coat and his suit.  His long black hair curls over his shoulders and you see, form his profile, he has a scar across his crooked nose.\\n\\nHe's rummaging through the glass case, pulling out rings, an offering bowl, beads, and tossing them carelessly to the ground.  \\n\\nYou don't approve of littering, so you walk up and put some of the valuable-looking items in your purse.  no doubt to give to the authorities ...\\n\\nHe pauses and turns to look at you.  He has deep grey green eyes and at this angle you can see a scar high up on his neck, almost as if someone has tried to cut his throat.  \"You're quite a confident girl.\"  \\n\\n\"Are you telling me I can't have these, handsome?\"  You inhale, wishing you had more of a cleavage to point at him, and toss aside the antique sandal you'd been considering.  That one can't be worth much.\\n\"My name is Matthias.  And I'm telling you, this is mine,\" he breathes, holding up his find.  It's the sacrificial dagger, one of the prize items in the collection.  It's gorgeous, electrum plated, inscribed with runes.  Wide bladed, hefty, and worth at least as much as its weight in gold.  Your mouth waters at the sight of it.\\n\\nBut you need to get your strategies straight, this is not the time or place to fight him for it.  You start to edge away.  If you can track down Danny, maybe he's come equipped with something helpful.  Then the two of you can jump this guy in the parking lot-\\n\\nDownstairs, people start screaming.  You turn and rush for the exit.  Matthias suddenly appears, blocking the doorway.  Fuck, how did he move that fast?\\n\\nHe shoves you back.  \"Stay put, you don't want to get tangled up with all of this.\"  And he vanishes.  \\n\\nYou rush over to the velvet rope just in time to see him stab a security guard with the dagger.  There's a hissing noise, like meat dropped in hot oil, and the guard explodes in a fireball of swirling blue white flames, that almost immediately turn into a cloud of ash.  You're staring, openmouthed, as the ash settles.  There's no sign of Matthias.  \\n \\nFuck.\\n\\nYou rub the goose bumps on your arms.  It's dark and lonely in here, and the screams downstairs have gotten louder ... almost as if whoever's making the racket is working their way upstairs.  Decision time.\\n\\n[[B6]]\\nThe man said to stay put, and that seems like a solid plan.  You're sure Danny will be fine.  Perfectly fine, just as fine as you are up here.\\n\\n[[B7]]\\nOr maybe you should try to stick close to the weirdo?  He does have a kick-ass weapon.  \\n",

It hasn't occurred to any of them to use the kebab skewers at hand on the circling vamps.  One portly man in a gore-stained shirt makes a brave attempt to beat a vamp's head in with the empty punch bowl ... before getting dragged over the dubious safety of the table by four vamps, who fall on him like wild dogs on a hunk of kobe beef.  \\n\\nYou spot a  two teenagers, one in an obnoxiously retro polka dot poodle skirt, the other in pancake makeup and her hair teased into a ratty beehive.  Poodle skirt leads the way to the rear fire exit, slips out, and locks the door behind her.  What a coward.  Beehive shoves at the latch and curses.  She turns and runs back down the hall.  A beefy vamp with quite a potbelly chases her.

They look almost like they're guarding it, their eyes a little saner, a little clearer.  They turn their heads and spot you, bodies tensing like a dog scenting an opened can of food.  But these well-trained animals don't spring for you.  You ... might be able to attack them, work around them, hell you may be able to talk to them.\\nOr maybe that's a terrible idea.

He's battered, multiple bites taken out of his once-very-sharp suit, and is holding his ribs like they hurt.   \\n\\n\\nNo matter how they ache, he is able to blur forward and snatch it from the air, centimeters ahead of Sadora.  She falls back, crying out.\\n\\n\\n\"FUCK NO!!!\" Ralon cries.\\n\\n\\nYou throw the heart and Matthias snatches it out of the air and shoves it under his shirt.  There's a wet, crunching noise and blood rushes from Matthias's eyes, a few trickles from his nose.  He wipes at his face and looks around, eyes going red, pupils swelled huge.\\n\\n\\n\"At last,\" he says.  His face is radiant with the first true happiness you've seen on it.  \"Thank you, my dear.\"\\n\\n\\nSadora appears.  She gapes at him.  Her mouth twitches down at the corners, tears filling her eyes ... and then the emotion shifts.  \"Well ... \" the Maker arches her eyebrows and smirks.  \"Not how I envisioned it, but you did win the contest.  Congratulations, my beloved.\"  She held her arms open to him.  \"Come to me, let us embrace our eternal life together.\"\\n\\n\\nMatthew takes her into his arms, holding tightly.  He looks at you over her shoulder and winks.  \\n\\n\\nHe reaches into his pocket, pulls out a stake that appears to be a broken chair leg, and plunges it through her heart.  She falls back, shrieking, though her cries sound more outraged than pained.  \\n\\n\\nThat changes when Matthias reaches into the new hole in her back and tears out her heart.  It is as ugly as the one that was in the jar, writhing, tentacled, something to linger in your nightmares.\\n\\n\\nHe crushes it in his hand.  There's a wet crunching noise, and when he opens his fingers only pulp falls out.\\n\\n\\n\"Nooooo!\" Now it's our turn to cry out because there goes your last chance of a cure, to cure at least one of your friends.  \\n\\n\\nRalon staggers over to the other side of the burning Maker.  He stares at Matthias.  \"Wow.  I really didn't think you had the balls to go through with it.\"  He crouches and sifts some of her ashes through his fingers.  \"You've changed since we were together.  Gotten more ruthless.\"  He looks up and smiles. \\n\\n\\n\"You have no idea.\"  Matthias offers him a hand up.\\n\\n\\nRalon takes it.\\n\\n\\nMatthias tugs him closer.  Ralon grins.  HIs grin changes to a rictus of shock as Matthias shoves his hand through the other vamp's chest and punches out the other side, destroying  his heart.\\n\\n\\nHe keeps his hand there, holding his former lover\u2019s body aloft as it explodes in a jet fuel rush of blue fire, gone in a second.\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" he says.  His eyes are sad. He brushes ash from his palms.\\n\\n\\n\"Please,\" you tell him.  \"You owe me.  Please do something to save my friends.\"\\n\\n\\nMatthias nods.  You lead him back up to where Danny and Misha rest, barely alive.  He reaches down and snaps Danny's neck.\\n\\n\\nYou bend to the side and vomit.\\n\\n\\n\"I regret that I must do this,\" he says to you.  \"I owe you such a debt, but I cannot repay you like this.  I have vowed to wipe out the vampiric pestilence.  I cannot add to their numbers, just as you cannot know how a fallen vampire suffers.  Every one of the strengths I had was outnumbered by the pain, the emptiness.  It eats away until nothing you were is left,  and all you can hope for is to one day ... stop.\"  He walks over to Misha and looks down at her.  \"I wasn't always like this.  I used to be a good man.  Being a vampire changed that.\"\\n\\n\\nHe kills her as well, and then escorts you from the castle.  By noon you are checked into another motel and he is sleeping.\\n\\n\\nYou go outside 'to buy a soft drink', make a stake from the holly bush growing outside the check-in office, and try to stake him.\\n\\n\\nIt doesn't work.  Do Master vampires ever sleep?  Do they just sense when they're in danger and wake up?  Not that it matters ...  He pins you  against the chintzy polka dotted bedspread and forces you to look into his eyes.  The vampiric glamour flows over you like a comforting grey wave.  Your emotions cloud over and part of you ... goes away.\\n\\n\\nMatthias takes you with him as he crosses the globe, hunting down every vampire he can find.  He is a relentless hunter, surprisingly decent company after a good kill.  You don't fight to get free.  He seems ... lonely.  Despite his clear purpose in life, 'kill all vampires, then myself', he seems adrift.  You are too, what you wanted in life is out of reach forever.  And hey, you always wanted to travel.\\n\\n\\nYou see the world and help him kill, visit museums and the theater with him and help him kill, research and train for combat and even more killing.  Years pass and your former life as an ordinary human, as a college student with hopes and dreams, fades away.  Matthias's dream keeps you going.  \\n\\n\\nYou work out, develop and build new weapons, and get quite good at taking down larval vamps and even revenants.  Once in a while, you point out that if you were stronger, for example if you were a vampire, then you could be even more help to his cause.  It doesn't matter if you are joking or if, deep down, you want it.  He always refuses.\\n\\n\\nOnly Matthias has the strength to kill another Maker, but you help there too.  He likes to use you as bait, to draw the Makers out.  There's something about your fresh, vitally alive smell and your sarcastic insults that tickles their taste buds ...\\n\\n\\nOne day, he finally tracks down an elusive duo of Makers who refuse to set down roots and make a lair like all the other sensible, easily located vamps you've fought.  While he's distracted dismembering one of them, the other comes after you.  She snaps your hydraulic crossbow in half, outruns your getaway car - a Maserati - and punches through the front windshield, tearing you out.\\n\\n\\nMatthias gets there in time to kill the Maker before she vanishes again, but it's too late for you.  He calls an ambulance and holds your broken body in his arms.  He rocks you, like a child, and you watch the vampire ashes drift off in the breeze, throwing the just-risen moon into shadow.  The last thing you feel is Matthias, pressing a kiss to your forehead.  \\n\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n[[L2]]\\nRestart the chapter?\\n\\n\\n[[Start]]\\nRestart from the beginning?\\n",

You twist a little, getting a better angle.\\n\\nSadora moans in pleasure, drinking harder.  \\n\\nSpots are dancing across your vision.  You hope you still have the strength for this!  You aim and shove it up in one brutal blow.\\n\\nGasping.  She's gasping for breath.  She staggers back, clutching at the handle of the dagger, her fingers as weak as moths against a window.  She drops to the ground and arches, every muscle tightening.  Blue flame rises from the handle of the dagger and races down her body.  She is still thrashing as the fire consumes her.  \\n\\nHer ash rises like a geyser, mixes with the rain pattering down from the ceiling, and falls again as droplets of mud.\\n\\nYou pick up the dagger.  Something else is in the mud used to be the vampire.  It's a tiny pool of blue liquid.  Is that the cure?  You can't risk it washing away.  You touch it and the liquid crawls up along your skin and pools in your palm.\\n\\nQuick.  Faster.  There's still time.\\n\\nYou lift the lid of the jar and toss it aside - it cracks against the floor.  Inside is a creature straight from your nightmares, heart shaped, tentacles wriggling in its little bath of congealing blood.  This is the kind of monster Sadora carried inside herself.\\n\\nThe heart's tentacles move faster, splashing in the blood as if it feels danger coming.  You stab it with the dagger, spearing it neatly and pulling it out.  It shudders and burns, and the cure drips out.\\n\\nYou hold these precious fluids in your palms and return to Misha and Danny.  \\n\\nMisha is closer.  The second you pour it between her lips she coughs and stirs, her skin getting a healthy, human color.  \\n\\nYou give the other cure to  Danny.  He jerks awake, burns and wounds melting away like they had never been.  He sits cautiously, then with growing confidence stands up, slumped against the wall, and rubs his face.  Misha walks in a tight circle, her face flushed.  \"I feel great,\" she says.\\n\\n\\n\"Yeah, right.\"  You laugh at her.  The two of them had looked like death just seconds before.  No way could they 'feel great'.\\n\\n\\nDanny takes off his glasses, squints at the far wall, and then tosses them aside.  \"I don't need these anymore.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Really?  The cure fixed your shitty eyesight?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, more than that.\"  Misha cracks her knuckles.  \"I feel like I could kick a rhino's ass.\"\\n\\n\\nDanny nods.  He turns and punches the nearby door, the motion so fast his arm is a blur ... and his fist goes right through the six inch plank.\\n\\n\\nMisha turns, kicking at one of the stalagmites.  It crumbles, rock scattering across the floor.  A few pieces bounce off her.  She laughs.\\n\\n\\n\"Fuck,\" You say.  \"That's pretty excellent.\"  You kind of wish you'd taken one of the cures.  \\n\\n\\nRalon limps over to the pile of ash that used to be his maker and nudges it with his combat boot.\\n\\n\\n\"Don't tell me you miss her,\" you say.\\n\\n\\nHe shrugs, eyes hooded.  \"Centuries.  I knew her centuries, owed her my life.  And now ... now there's no hope for better.

There goes your plan to be the biggest baddest vampkiller around.\"\\n\\n\\nMatthias grimaces.  \"I may not get a maker\u2019s heart, I may never be able to kill the makers and permanently end the undead pestilence, but I can kill other, lesser vampires and their miserable spawn.  And so I shall.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, another threat?\"  Ralon cracks his knuckles and licks his lower lip.  \"I like it when you get all aggressive like that.\"\\n\\n\\nMatthias snarls and rushes at him.  \\n\\n\\nDanny and Misha pick up stakes from the shattered piano nearby.

According to the helpful tourist's information sign you pass by, Cailleach castle used to be massive and impressive-looking.  Then it exploded.  The leading theories were that natural gas seeped into the cellars and was set off by a candle, or that someone was experimenting with alchemy and created something unstable like dynamite.  The explosion led to the castle burning down.  Years later some of the ruins were raided to build stone fences in nearby village, then more stones were scooped up to save costs as the lower castle was restored.  Basically, most of Cailleach Castle isn't there anymore.  Good news!  It'll be less work to search.  \\n\\nYou make it to the castle without being attacked by any undead monstrosities and survey the ruins.  The main hall is teetering on the edge of a hill overlooking the forest and beyond that, Lake Nathair.  In fact, that outer wall facing the Loch is leaning over forty degrees like it's planning to commit suicide diving down the ill.  The hall itself has largely fallen to rubble, huge sections of the floor having collapsed into the underground chambers.  Some of the buttresses are still intact.  They cut across the dawn sky like the ribs of a huge dead animal.  The tower that stands more inland, closer to the restored castle, is more or less vertical although you see sections of the wall don't look reassuringly intact.  \\n\\n[[E8]]\\n\\nAre you going up the tower, to get a bird's eye view of the situation?\\n\\n[[E9]]\\n\\nAre you going to poke around the crumbling main hall?\\n\\n",

I may be a monster but I need not act like one.\"\\n\\n\"But seriously, blood from a grease burger joint?\"  Once he'd reached the charming, tourist-trap village of Nathair, he'd slowed as he passed the pubs, the teenagers huddled by the bus stop, the shops crowded with brightly painted, badly made tourist crap ... and rolled into the drive through window for a local burger place.  You would have appreciated a breakfast sausage or something, but Matthias was there on his own mission.

Loch Nathair is a dark, winding line to your right, twisting among the hills like a black wound.  Probably gorgeous in the day, though.

According to the internet, there's also a tour of the public areas and organized birdwatching- ah, here they come.\"  \\nYou see a bus drive up the access road and park at the top of the hill outside the castle's privacy fence.\\n\\nMatthias puts away his fast food bag and continues.  \"The hag lives in crypts below the castle, but unfortunately they are difficult to access.  Cailleach Castle was destroyed centuries ago in a brief war my maker had with her once-allies, a coven of witches.  The ruins of the castle extend along the  hill to overlook the Loch, and there are scattered outbuildings in the woods.  I have not been to see her in decades, but I recall there was an Oubliette where her victims would be thrown.  She must have had some way to reach those victims, therefore it is an access point.  The oubliette is somewhere in the forest by the Loch. \"\\n\\n\"And what is that?\"\\n\\n\"An ancient method of torture in which one's victim is sealed in a tower, well, or secret chamber and left to die.\"\\n\\n\"Charming.\" And he wants to go inside one.  Willingly.  And ... wait for the evil vampire Maker to collect her prey?  \"Isn't there another way in?\"\\n\\n\"Hm.  I heard rumor of a well, somewhere in the gardens or perhaps the maze ... but we cannot attempt it.  Those innocents-\" he waves at the people filing off the bus, \"would be imperiled.  And they might get in our way, which would drive me to an unfortunate choice.\"\\n\\n\"Hypnotize them?\"\\n\\n\"Of course not.  I cannot waste my hard-gotten potency on so many people.  I would have to kill them.  Quickly and humanely.\"\\n\\nYou really, really don't want to have to go through the torture chamber.  \"But you could use your glamour on them, and then drink from a couple to top up the ol' gas can... \"\\n\\n\"Impossible.  That would be quite evil.\"\\n\\nYou shake your head and follow him out of the car.  He sets off at a quick pace and you linger behind as Danny stumbles after him.\\n\\n[[E2]]\\n\\nAccording to the plastic tourist information sign, 'Old Fallen Cailleach' is less than a kilometer ahead.  \\n",

Since the sun isn't up yet, it's just as dark and creepy as you'd expected.\\n\\nA slow, icy breeze seems to curl up from the Loch itself, and fog starts to thicken along the ground.  You keep an eye out for a sturdy branch you could turn into a stake.\\n\\nA few hundred feet in, you come across two hikers.  They have small backpacks on and are bundled up in matching orange windbreakers against the cold.  They're staring at a worn-out tourist info sign at a fork in the path and muttering to each other.

That little thing that keeps us in tuition, pizza, and beer.\"\\n\\n\"Details.\"\\n\\nMatthias interrupts.  \"There are quite a few magical traps in the woods, mostly snares to disorient humans, and draw my maker's creatures when the prey is easily handled.  We shall need to move carefully ... fortunately, there are quite a few hikers, fishermen, and tourists wandering the area.

The spell of course did not kill my maker, but it does linger over the exits from her lair.  If we can find those remaining traces, we will find the entrance to the crypt.\"\\n\\n\"So what exactly does a blight spell look like?\"\\n\\n\"I've never encountered one, only heard the legends.   The land itself grows sick, unnatural ... predatory.\"\\n\\n\"That's really helpful.\"  You dodge Danny's elbow.  \"Where do we start?\"\\n\\nMatthias gestures to your left, where the forest sweeps down off the hill Cailleach Castle sits on and eventually fetches against the water.  \"The walking trail was diverted away from beside the Loch in this area ... perhaps to draw mistress's prey closer to her lair's entrance.\"  He gestures atop the hill, where you see a ruined tower and several walls of the old tall leaning like they are about to dive down the hill.  \"It is possible the Oubliette was built into the castle itself.  Alternatively, the next hill beyond may now be a pasture overrun with sheep, but it also contains standing stones.  I know my maker learned much of her magic from the old religion, and perhaps her abilities are still tied to these relics.\"\\n\\nHe runs his hand over his jaw and paces in a slow circle.  You get the feeling you'd better jump in and make a choice, fast.  His so-called 'plan' doesn't have a lot of consideration for your or Danny's well-being.  \\n\\n[[E3]]\\n\\nWould you like to investigate the Loch trail and the dark, haunted-looking forest?  \\n\\n[[E4]]\\n\\nWould you like to check out the creepy, skeletal castle? \\n\\n[[E5]]\\n\\nWould you like to check out the field of innocent-looking but no doubt murderous sheep, and the one hundred percent not evil standing stones?\\n",

He's streaked with blood and limping but still fast enough to grab it, in a flying leap, just ahead of Sadora.\\n\\n\\nThe Maker gasps and backs of.\\n\\n\\n\"NOOOOOOO!!!!\" Matthias wails.  \\n\\n\\nRalon roars with joy, tears his shirt open and you throw the heart at his chest.  It hits him and burrows under the skin and you watch in sick fascination as it burrows under the corded muscles, rearranges his rubs.\\n\\n\\nHe chokes out a spray of blood and wipes his lips.  His eyes gleam red.\\n\\n\\n\"Thanks, pet.\"  \\n\\n\\nMatthias pulls a stake - possibly a broken chair leg - from his coat and rushes forward in a blur of motion.  \\n\\n\\nRalon turns and tears his chest open, crushes his heart, in one smooth motion so fast you can't follow it.  One moment he's standing there wiping his face, the next he has killed Matthias.\\n\\n\\nHe drops the heart and stumbles backwards.  Blood trickles off his hands.  Slowly, he raises them and licks his old lover's last essence off his fingers as he watches the man burn.\\n\\n\\n\"Uh, are you okay?\"\\n\\n\\nRalon scrubs the sole of his combat boot over the dunes of ash that used to be Matthias.  He shakes his head, eyes wide, helplessly.\\n\\n\\n\"I thought you wanted him dead?\"  If not, he could get angry reeeeeaaaallly fast.  And you're the one standing closest to him.  You've seen him lose his shit before and it never ends well for the humans around him.\\n\\n\\n\"I did.  I do.\"  He shakes his head and frowns.  \"I did.\"  He swallows.  \"It's ... over.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What is this?\" Sadora appears.  She looks from the empty jar to the still-healing hole in Ralon's chest.  \"You bastard.\"  Her eyes narrow into malevolent slits ... and then she bursts into high pitched, trilling laughter.  \"Well done!  I see the better man won.  I am so glad to see an end to the fighting.  Now you and I can be together, for all eternity.\"  She holds her hands out to him, offering an embrace.\\n\\n\\nHe spits venom at her.  \\n\\n\\nShe scowls and backs away, brushing at the new stains on her pink negligee.\\n\\n\\n\"I'm sick of all the games and double talk.  I need to less time with you, and more with honest people.  No holds barred people.  People like ... her.\"  He points at you.\\n\\n\\n\"Humans don't last very long,\" she says softly.  \"You'll return to me soon enough.\"  You don't like the hostile look in her eyes as she looks at you.  You step behind Ralon.\\n\\n\\nHe grabs you around the waist and rushes you out, killing the few simulacra that dare to get in his way.\\n\\n\\n\"Wait!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Stop struggling, I have to take you with me or she'll kill you for sure.\\n\\n\\n\"But what about my friends?\"\\n\\n\\n\"What?  Oh, yeah.  I'll turn them.  Only way to keep 'em alive.  But I gotta feed first.  I've got a fire in my gut, and right now you're the only human around.  You picking up what I\u2019m putting down?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Let's get you to the village,\" you say nervously.\\n\\n\\nRalon grins.\\n\\n\\nOne village and one day later, he comes out of his bloodlust.  It's too late for your friends.  You cry and scream, and try to stake him.  He looks annoyed and apologizes.  Not good enough.  You wait until he's sleeping in the day and come up with another stake.\\n\\n\\nHe snaps awake, knocks the stake from your hands, and glamours you.  \\n\\n\\nIt all goes hazy ... you remember what he did, all the feeling has been erased from that memory.  You forgive him soon enough.  What choice do you have?  They're gone, and his Maker keeps sending  you threatening messages in vague terms that are even scarier than if she'd come out and said 'I\u2019m going to eat your liver, out of your body, as you watch and scream.'\\n\\n\\nA girl's gotta have her priorities, and your number one goal is honoring Danny's last coherent words and staying alive ... in one form or another.\\n\\n\\nIt would be a lot easier to stay alive if you were a vampire.  Ralon's a master now, he could turn you into lower vamp like he was.  It didn't seem so bad.  But he refuses.  Says he prefers when you smell like a living animal instead of a dead one.  Secretly, you suspect he's worried you'll try to kill him again if you ever become a strong enough vampire to shrug off the glamour.  You probably couldn\u2019t kill a Maker but you're sure you could cause him a lot of pain ...  \\n\\n\\nHe promises to turn you if you ever get really sick or hurt, or when you start to 'get fat and ugly and old', as he puts it.  You stick close to him, help lure victims for him to feed on so he doesn't get too peckish when there's just you around, and bide your time.\\n\\n\\nA few years pass.  Ralon gets increasingly distracted.  He claims Glasgow and the surrounding area as 'his territory', and obsessively patrols the borders of it.  He and his Maker argue over territory quite a lot.  The magic entrapping Sadora weakens and one year she is able to go aboveground within the confines of the castle property.  Soon she'll be able to escape, and Ralon obsesses over her coming to 'poach his property'.  The arguments between them grow ugly.   You wonder if it's something to do with them being two Makers now, unable to live close to each other.  Or maybe it's their foul personalities ....\\n\\n\\nIt comes around the time when the Maker embraced Ralon, his six hundredth (or is it seven hundredth?  eight?  you forget) birthday.  Ralon and you go back to the castle to enjoy a birthday party ... but you don't enjoy it long. \\n\\n\\nRalon and Sadora get into a tremendous argument over (what else?) territory.  He storms out, leaving you to drag to the trunk of his Lamborghini Diablo the bloody, nubile 'birthday cake' his maker had kidnapped for him.\\n\\n\\nYou shove the woman in and slam the trunk closed, and feel cold breath on your neck.\\n\\n\\n\"What are you doing?\" you ask, your voice shaking.\\n\\n\\n\"Teaching my boy about respect,\" she spits out.\\n\\n\\nShe tears into you and leaves you bleeding on the hood of the Diablo.  Ralon comes back in a quarter of an hour and finds you like that.  Immediately, he tears open his wrist and presses it to your mouth.  \\n\\n\\n\"My pet, no, not my pet, c'mon kitten, drink from me.  I'll make this all better, take better care of you.  Please, pet.  Not you, too.  Don't leave me alone.\"  \\n\\n\\nBut you're too weak, too far gone.  The last thing you see is the Maker walking up, smiling beatifically.\\n\\n\\nRalon turns and you hear the wolf howl, that sound you hadn't heard in years.  He rushes for her.  Maybe he manages to kill her.  Maybe they kill each other.  You can't hold onto life long enough to find out.\\n\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n[[L2]]\\nRestart the chapter?\\n\\n\\n[[Start]]\\nRestart from the beginning?\\n",

The heart is an actual, physical thing?\"\\n\\n\"Physical and mystical.\"  She leaves her throne, crouches to the right of it, and slides two fingers into a chip in one of the paving stones.  That chip turns out to be a finger hold that lets her pull the stone plate off.  \\n\\n\"So how does it turn someone into a Maker?\"\\n\\nShe sets the stone aside.  \"Start with something beyond human understanding.  Graft it into a lowly human or wretched fallen vampire and watch it transform the sacrificial host.  It gives a life beyond death, and can gift life to the dying.\"\\n\\n\"So an infusion of blood from a true vampire can save someone who's dying?\"\\n\\n\"No, an infusion can boost the strength of one already made vampire, give them the potency to fight off their demise.  For one still alive, or somewhat alive, you need the dregs of blood from a dying Heart to restore them.  If you have the means to sacrifice it.\"  She chuckles.  \"There is little in this world that can damage something so glorious.\"\\n\\nYou are reluctant to go near her, even though rationally, you know she can kill you no matter what corner of the room you're standing in.  You swallow and force yourself to walk close enough to peek into the hidden compartment in the floor.\\n\\nThere is a clay jar about two feet long and nine inches across.  It has an odd lid, a ceramic disc with runes carved into it and a hole the size of a small fist in the middle.\\nThe Maker glances at you and smiles.  \"Like all organs, it is sustained with blood.  My treasure gets fed weekly, just as I do.  From the local hospital, senior activity center, tourists, hikers, schoolchildren visiting on an educational outing ... I have kept it alive, I have thrived, despite the ignoble bondage the witches left me in.\"  \\n\\nShe pours blood through the hole until the fluid reaches the top of the jar.  You watch as the blood level slowly but steadily sinks.  \"Feed, my dear,\" she croons, tapping her nails against that lid.  \\n\\nYour heart is racing.  You've seen some weird shit in the last twenty four hours but this is something else.  \"Is that it?  The heart?  The heart's in there?\"  You hear a note of hysteria in your voice.  \\n\\nSomething moves, stirring up the surface of the remaining blood before sinking down again.  \\n\\n\"What - how many hearts do you have in there?\"\\n\\n\"Just one.  There are too few of us left in the world, and each heart is precious.  Each heart deserves only the best as a host.  In my lifetime I have seen many candidates, and they all proved unworthy.  Speaking of my sons,\" she straightens and replaces the paving stone, \"Let us see why my lack witted servants haven't returned from their latest search.  Pet, fetch me my parasol.\"  She gestures at the Japanese hanging on the left.\\n\\nYou reach behind it and pull out a traditional-style Japanese parasol.  It has a gorgeous moon-in-cloudy-skies print on the paper shade, as well as a bamboo handle and spokes.  The tip of the parasol looks passably sharp.\\n\\n[[H15]]\\n\\nAre you going to take a chance and try to stake her with this handy weapon?  \\n\\n[[H16]]\\n\\nWould you like to wait on that staking until a little later?\\n",

This one is a three story high hall connecting a warren of multiple alcoves, roughly hewn chambers, and burrow-like tunnels at every height.  You look up and even the roof is pitted.  More of those ghostly tattered cloths are drifting around up there; as you watch, one of them curls up in the roof pit.  It looks like its nesting.\\n\\nSo this is where her creations sleep.  You look around, estimating at least a hundred alcoves connect through here.  Even if the monsters aren't willing to have roommates, that is really bad odds for your escape plan.\\n\\nNot that you have an escape plan.\\n\\nShe draws herself up, looking every inch a queen despite wearing a nightgown and no shoes.  \"Where is the phalanx?\" she snaps.\\n\\nA bent creature in a monk's robe hobbles over.

I must have justice.\"\\n\\n\"Silence, you crawling maggot!\"  She takes a deep breath.  \"Boys,\" she calls out, her voice ringing and clear.  Oddly enough, she doesn't echo. \"My boys, I have your pets.  Ralon, I smell your blood in the girl.  Matthias, I sense your glamour clouding the boy's mind.  You'd best come out and collect them.\"  She pauses a moment.  \"The twins are hungry.\"\\n\\nShe turns and walks back.  You are no fool to stand around the hall of irate supernatural beasties, especially since you've killed at least one of their number.  You follow her.\\n\\nShe reenters the room with the Zen garden and the unspeakably creepy jar of blood and pauses.  She turns in a slow circle, spinning her parasol.  \"Pet, I grow bored.\"\\n\\nYou're running low on talents, but you can give it a shot.  You're trying to decide between sharing the amusing story of what happened when your parents forgot you at the mall the first time, or your very bad impression of Christopher Walken.\\n\\n\"Dearest maker!\" \\n\\nYou know that voice.  It's Matthias!  He walks in, hands in his pockets, looking so cool and confident he must have a plan to save the day!\\n\\nRalon pauses in the doorway and kicks a metal armored helmet into the room.

Old blood in the gaps between each stone, blood that leads in a trail from where you came to the double archway in front.  \\n\\nThe remaining minions come in after you in a sudden rush.  Two of them have fresh, bleeding slices on their faces.

It's a high, soft voice, a young woman's or maybe a child's.  Those grey gossamer strands you saw before in the wine cellar drop from the ceiling and trail over your skin like fingers.  They move past you and descend on the feral vampires, wrapping them like mummies and dragging them into the void.  One grabs Misha- Ralon drags her back, the gossamer rips and that monster flees.  \\n\\nRalon and Misha hurry through the leftmost archway, leaving you with these ... ghosts?

What if there's some kind of weird vampire magic on it, too?  There's a fireplace - no poker, just a flimsy looking little shovel for scooping out ashes.  Closet - curtains - unmade bed - fuck!\\n\\nRalon manages to get a tight grasp on one of the three howling, struggling hounds.  He snaps its neck and flings the body aside.  He bites another on the throat and immediately lets go, spitting out a mouthful of blood that turns immediately to oily black smoke.  That hound grabs the collar of his makeshift shirt and drags him to the floor, the third circling around trying to fasten onto his Achilles tendons.\\n\\nYou shove past that mess and back into the hallway.  The vamps are wrestling with another hellhound.  This one is bigger than the others, a dark red instead of black.  It's wearing a collar studded with razor blades.  It snaps at you, hackles rising.\\n\\nMisha pushes in front of you and punches it in the teeth and throat.  The hound staggers back a step and shakes its head.  Misha grimaces and shakes her fist - you see her knuckles and back of her fingers are lacerated from that collar.\\n\\nThe hound growls, a deep bass rumble that you feel vibrating up through the floor.  It's almost like the house itself is getting angry -\\n\\nThat's crazy talk.  You shake yourself out of it and look around wildly.\\n\\nThere - above the unattractive pineapple-shaped lamp that half-illuminates this hallway, you see a huge rack of antlers mounted to a wooden plate on the wall.  You scramble atop the little table, accidentally kicking the lamp down and smashing it.  You grab for the antlers and realize they're wooden, some kind of tacky wooden replica.\\n\\nYou hang your weight from them and they fall.  The weight's too much and you tumble to the ground on top of them, knocking out your breath.\\n\\nThere\u2019s another growl and you hear that demon hound scratching at the wooden flooring, rushing for you.  You see Misha grab it around the neck, blood rushing down her arm where she holds it.  She stands up, showing you the hound's belly.  You lift the replica antlers and stake it through the chest.\\n\\nThe hound shivers oddly, skin seeming to shrink and melt tightly against its bones.  It goes limp, eye sockets empty.\\n\\nShe drops it and massages her arm.  You can see bone glinting through the wounds, and a few traces of black mixing with her red blood.  As you watch, the wounds start to heal.\\n\\n\"Whew!\"  Ralon walks out, bloodied and battered.  In the room you see the three limp bodies of the hellhounds.  As you watch, they grow more and more transparent, literally melting away like nighttime frost in morning sunlight.\\n\\n\"Knowing the hag, there's more on the way,\" he says.\\nGreat.\\n\\nHe grabs you by the arm and everyone hustles down the spiral staircase.  You go down several floors, and then it ends at a creepy, worn wooden door.\\n\\nOverhead, something howls.\\n\\n\"Jesus shit, give it a rest,\" Ralon mutters.  He shoves you and the vamps into the room and shuts the door in a hurry.\\nHe sparks his lighter and you see the inside of the door has claw marks  and no doorknob.  You're trapped down here now.  Just you, and these bloodthirsty vampires ...\\nand whatever that thing standing with its back to the door is.

From your own hands when your bloodlust takes hold, or dead by your massive list of enemies including three different bands of hunters ... or dead from the weak, tainted blood you forced upon her.  You're not worthy of a companion.\"\\n\\nThe overly dramatic trash talk seems to strike a nerve.  Ralon grabs one of the smashed jars on the floor and slits Matthias's throat with it.  Matthias blurs away, holding his throat together.  \"Fuck you!  Fuck you twice!  At least I have fun, and I keep my people around as long as they last, to the bitter end.  I don't leave them behind in Madrid while I'm off worshipping at the shrine of Kill-my-own-kind!  Yeah, I know all about that Benedictine monk you recruited last century. The two of you were so close, not that I'm jealous!\"  He rushes Matthias and gets thrown headfirst into the passageway you're standing in - you and Danny duck as he sails by.

You are two of a kind.\"\\n\\nMatthias slips the dagger away and hauls Misha over by the hair.

You try not to think what happened to the corpses.\\n\\nYou are led to the largest chamber yet.  It has alcoves between the pillars holding up the roof, dead flowers and arrangements of bones in said alcoves.  There is a round table weighted with candelabras in the middle of the floor.  The roof's painted a delicate fresco of blue sky and fluffy clouds and cherubs playing flutes and so forth.  There's a dais with a delicate-looking wrought-iron chair with cushions embroidered with scenes of cranes hunting fish.  Two scrolls flank the odd little throne; they look like traditional Japanese prints of storm-tossed waves and a bamboo forest.   The maker must be a fan of Japanese culture as there's a gravel Zen garden.  A dead man in boxers is hanging from his ankles above the garden, blood running from his cut throat into a bowl on the ground.\\n\\n\"Misssstresssss!  Tributesssss!\"\\n\\nOne of the Japanese hangings is swept aside and you get your first look at Matthias and Ralon's Maker.  She's ballerina-thin, maybe five feet tall, with unreal paperwhite skin, china blue eyes, and long black hair that gleams like the fur of an animal as it trails over her pink robe.  A matching pink negligee is peeking out from under it.\\n\\nShe sniffs the air raises her eyebrows.  \"You consider these things a fitting tribute?\"\\n\\nBy this time you've gotten used to vampires blurring with speed.  She's even faster.  She just ... appears next to the armored monster that had spoken.  \"Idiot.\"   She backhands it, and its armored head rolls off.  One of the others picks the head up and sticks it back on.\\n\\nShe sniffs again and points at Danny.  \"Mortally wounded, his life-force almost completely drained away.\"  She points at Misha.  \"This one is clearly rotting, her body filled with blood too weak to complete the transition.  They both reek of death.\"  She sniffs again and points to you.  \"This one may suffice.

Do fetch me the two vampires!\" She hesitates, listening to something you can't catch, and smiles with satisfaction.\\n\\nThat throws a wrench into their plans.  Of course, from what you've seen Ralon and Matthias are pretty bad in the planning department so this may not make a big difference in the final outcome.  \\n\\nThe Maker lets you go and walks backwards to pose, regal as a queen on a throne, in that chair.  \"Yet you are still alive ... you must have done something to catch their attention.  Well, little pet?  Show me your trick.\" \\n\\nSince the alternative to performing for her amusement is apparently getting strung up like that guy in the boxers, you'd better think of something. \\n\\n[[H7]]\\n\\nSpontaneous haiku?\\n\\n[[H8]]\\n\\nFunny limerick?\\n\\n[[H9]]\\n\\nSexy dance?\\n",

He drops his fangs and drags them over Danny's throat, goading Matthias.  \\n\\nMatthias's eyes widen in outrage and he tips Misha's head farther back.\\n\\n\"Hey!\"  You toss a shard of pottery at Ralon; it bounces off his head.  You pull up some of the court-appointed-psychologist-speak you heard too much of in your teenage years.  \"I hear you saying that you feel Matthias has grown and changed into someone very different from the man you used to know.\"\\n\\n\"A fucking fanatic,\" he spits out.  \"A square with your soul as dead as your dick.  What's the point in living forever if you won't live at all?\"\\n\\nYikes.  \"Now, Matthias, I'm hearing you say-\"\\n\\nMatthias's eyes are wide with offense.  \"As opposed to wallowing in every cruel excess, every perversion, trying to make numbed nerves feel again?  You waste those innocent humans' lives, and you waste your time.  As long as we are fallen vampires, as long as we lack a true vampire heart, we will be burdened with blunted emotions.\"\\n\\n\"What a bunch of bullshit.  All this holier-than-thou spouting about how you don't like it when I kill people, when I rip up relics of the past, but I know what your real problem with me is.  You're pissed off that I told your family about us.  It's not like you gave me a choice.  You were going to marry that boring little wannabe nun they had picked out.  You're angry that I gave your fucking parents the truth, and you're even angrier that your little sister died while we were away in England letting the heat die down.\"\\n\\n\"W-Marie?  NO, I rarely-\"\\n\\n\"Oh really?  She was tortured by the church for helping us escape, and you don't think about her?\"\\n\\n\"I wish I could grieve as a human would, mourn as she deserves ... but my numbed heart will not cooperate.  She is in my thoughts, now and again, but not in my heart.\"\\n\"Every century you show up with another girl who looks like her, acts like her.  You rub it in my face, that what I started ended so badly.  Maybe it's your fucked up vampire emotions that you won't let the past go.\"\\n\\nYou interrupt.  \"This is why you guys should work together.  Your maker has another true vampire heart, right?  Let's have some teamwork, kill her, and take it off her.  You'll solve all your problems, work on your issues.  Killing her is the healthy choice.\"  \\n\\nRalon drums his fingers against Danny's chest and frowns.  \"The hag has been dangling that heart between us since she made us.  It would be nice to see her get hers'.\"\\n\\n\"To finally evolve, instead of trapped, half dead and half on the other side.\" Matthias continues.\\n\\nThey release their hostages and shake hands.  \"Looks like we've got an alliance of opportunity.\\n\\n[[H5]]\\n\\nAww, they're growing as people ...\\n",

See, in my first plan I turn a bunch of disposable soldier-\"\\n\\n\"Including my friend Misha.\"  Can't let him forget about that.\\n\\n\"Right, sure.  Misha.  And we get the jump on Matthias before he can get a hold of that dagger.  This didn't work out too well.  He's got the dagger, used it on me and I'm dying, though I poisoned him so I guess he's going down with me.  And that bastard's finally given in and glamoured himself an ally.  Not that I'm worried about a squashy little human who's dying from the hungry magic of the dagger-\"\\n\\nYou don't want him to think your other friend's an easy target to just be disposed of.  \"Danny's smart.  You might be surprised how much damage he can do.\"  \\n\\nRalon bares his fangs at you.  You lean away and take the hint, biting your tongue.  \\n\\n\"Right,\" he growls.  \"The plan.  I gotta get some replacement juice from my maker. She's a true blooded vampire, not a hybrid, and her blood can beat this magic back . But the time's ticking.  She's always had a kinda fatal attraction to Matthias.  Wouldn't kill him, even after he tried to stake her.  If he gets to her first, he might be able to talk her out of saving me, too.  So we gotta hustle to the castle she haunts.\"\\n\\n\"We?\"  IT's been a long, tiring night, and you recently quit your meds.  Maybe that's why you keep talking back.  You really should smile, lie, and get the fuck out of here as soon as you can ... but your mouth runs away from you again.  \"Why the fuck should I help you at all?\"\\n\\n\"Because you're hung up on your friends.  You can't face that they're doomed to die ... and maybe they aren't,\" he purrs, his voice a dark hypnotic threat.  \"Maybe you can talk my maker into changing them.  Maybe she knows a cure; after all, she's been allies with witch families for centuries.  She loves to keep secrets, but she also loves to show off so you could possibly goad her into saving them.  Or maybe Matthias has a cure since he's an egghead always buried in an arcane tome... you just might have luck getting a straight answer from that coy bastard.\"  He licks his fangs and grins.  \"Or you can sit back and watch your friends die ... but I don't think you're the type to give up hope that easily.  You're stupid that way.  Just like I used to be.\"\\n\\nHe does have a good point.  \\n\\nYou frown and try to think . This whole situation just doesn't make sense.  Why hasn't he eaten you yet?  Why is he, in a roundabout way, asking you to come along?  \\n\\n\"Why am I here?  You've obviously got some kind of plan for me.\"\\n\\nRalon shrugs.  \"Why do you think?  I could want you around to distract Matthias.  I mean he always has had a soft spot for pretty petite brunettes who look kind of like his long-lost sister ... Or maybe I just want to pack a snack.\"  He walks over and pulls you to your feet.  \"Maybe I think you're one of the strong ones, and I wanna turn you as soon as I'm a maker and can turn vampires who will survive.  There's only one way you'll find out.\"\\n\\nAgain, he's asking.  You get a feeling he won't keep asking forever, and you don't want to be killed or spend the rest of the night locked in the trunk of a car.  It looks like you're travelling with him ... for the time being.\\n\\n[[D11]]\\n\\nIt looks like he doesn\u2019t think you're much threat, since he's willing to let you run around on foot.  Maybe he's cocky enough that he'll let you arm yourself ... with a shiv made from that broken magical dagger?\\n\\n[[D12]]\\n\\nOn the other hand, you may have pushed your luck enough.

She struts up to another man like tall, strong, and cut Amazon.  \"Yo,\" she grabs his arm which is more than you would have, the guy is wearing tattered pajama bottoms and a grey sweater with cigarette burns.  \"We need to find the Whiteshoal Inn.\"\\n\\n\"Damn you, lassie, damn you to hell!\"  He spits at her.\\n\\nMisha gets this a lot from her Holy Roller family in Kansas, so she dodges without a problem.  \\n\\nThe man finishes off his bottle of scotch, smashes it in the street, and staggers away.  This is your kind of town.\\n\\nDanny's turn.  Maybe he'll have more luck.  He smooths back his dark hair - it's been growing out since he was too busy with finals, especially Ancient Latin, to get a cut.  He straightens his poorly-fitting business-casual outfit and walks up to the next man you find.  This guy is wearing a kilt that barely covers half his thighs.\\n\\n\"Excuse me,\" Danny says politely.\\n\\nThe man reaches under his kilt and adjusts his package.  \"Oh, I do excuse you.  Any way you like.\"  He wiggled his eyebrows.\\n\\nThe three of you get out of there.\\n\\nDanny pulls out his phone.   \"This is ridiculous.  I was trying to avoid roaming charges, but I guess I'll have to use my GPS app.\"   In a minute, the three of you are off.  Good old dependable, organized Danny.\\n\\nHe leads you to the hotel, where you wash the economy class stink off and collapse in bed.  This is no way to live it up, but your body's been weakened with three weeks of finals and partying, and you don't have the strength to fight jet lag.  \\n\\nYou wake up a few hours later.  It's sunset.  Your phone is blinking - it's a text from Danny.  He's gone to a local museum, which is showcasing ancient Roman weapons on loan from a dig site in Eastern Europe.  He invites you to come along.  History class is one of the few courses you enjoyed.  The pictures he forwarded from the museum's brochure look amazing.  Silver crowns, jeweled scepters, gilded books, Damascene weaponry, so so many things small enough to fit into your purse.  Coincidentally, of course.  You would love to get a look at one of the artifacts.  Maybe more than just a look ...\\n\\nNo!  You won't go back to your bad old ways.  No thieving in Scotland.\\n\\nAt any rate, since it's opening night of the exhibit there will probably be free appetizers and maybe even champagne ...\\n\\nMisha is also out.  She wrote on your arm - in indelible sharpie because she's a bitch - the following invitation:\\n\\n'HEY SKANK, GONE TO DEADFALLS CONCERT, GREENE STREET, BE THERE OR FUCK YOU!'\\n\\nNow, you never got into the whole Metal lifestyle but you like the Deadfalls' music.  Hmm, an evening cruising hot guys, getting into trouble with Misha, hopefully not landing in jail or catching any STDs, and there would definitely be booze ... at concert prices.  That would take a bite out of our budget.\\n\\n[[A1]]\\nGet shitfaced with Misha?\\n\\n[[B1]]\\nJoin Danny, and see how serious the museum is about it's 'look but don't touch' policy?\\n",

Your only advantage is the element of surprise, and having armed backup.\\n\\n\"Alright, Danny, I'll go in first and -\"\\n\\nHe's not listening.  He's staring down the hallway at the knot of vampires stumbling over the freshly dead bodies of their prey in their haste to get at the living ones.  Someone in there is howling again.  \\n\\n\"Incredible,\" he says softly.  His voice rises.  \"Outrageous!\"\\nThat's not helping your element of surprise.  \"What's wrong?\"\\n\\n\"Do you see that?  I - there it is again!  Someone stole the druid dagger!  The one I was going to liberate!!\"\\n\\n\"Okay, calm down.\"  Jesus, he's turning purple with rage.  Is he off his meds again?  He's a pretty delicate flower who needs to ramp down gently.  Not like you.  You went cold turkey with no side effects whatsoever.

He runs down the hall toward the maelstrom at its end.\\n\\n\"Shit!\"  You kick the security door open and charge in, stake raised in the air.

Thankfully the second guy was wearing boxers ... since that's the area you drop into ...\\n\\nNot so thankfully, you see you broke the stake when you fell.\\n\\nYou struggle to your feet and look around.  There's corpses stacked like firewood at the far end, throats and wrists torn out, the occasional bite mark on a thigh.  They've been stripped, you guess that's where the vamps got all those uniforms.  The lockers have been busted open - metal doors that have claw and fist marks imbedded in them.  The security monitors are not visible behind a thick spray of drying, brown blood.  Even the coffee machine has been smashed.\\n\\nThere's nothing for you here.  You curse and head back into the hall.\\n\\nYou edge your way down, hearing weird noises.  \\n\\nSSSSSSSSSSHHH.  A weird sizzle, and a blink-and-you'll-miss-it flare of blue light. One less vamp, it seems.  \\n\\nA hush falls.  What happened to all the screams?  Is everybody dead?\\n\\nYou press against the wall and peek around the corner.  No sign of Danny.  Instead, you see the vamps in a circle, staring intently at two figures in front of the door.\\n\\nA voice you haven't heard before says, \"How interesting.  All those humans running and hiding, just like little rabbits.  And one human that's coming closer.  Come out,  tasty thing.  Or I'll send my dogs to fetch you.\"\\n\\nB18\\nWell, since he asked politely...\\n",

Down, boy.\"  \\n\\nThe vamp does not, in fact, back down.  He stalks forward.  You back away, slowly.  He speeds up.  You jerk backwards, hit the wall.

Your heart races faster, and you wonder if he can hear it, like a dinner bell welcoming him to feed on you.\\n\\nThe door to the men's room swings open, banging against the wall, and Danny bursts out of it.  He's smeared with blood, most of it weirdly black, and his sleeves are dusted with ash. \\n\\nThe vampire looks over at him and hisses.  Danny punches it in the teeth, and you kick it in the crotch.  The rack maneuver doesn't seem to do much but the vamp does lose his balance.  He doubles over, cupping a hand over his mouth and moaning.  \\n\\nDanny seizes him by the belt, and you grab the vamp's legs and the two of you shove it into the men's room.  Danny pulls out of his inner pocket a bump key, shoves it into the lock, turns the lock halfway and breaks the key off.  \\n\\nThe door is jammed.

Sounds like one less vamp for you to worry about.\\n\\n\"Danny, my man.  You've gotta focus for me.\"  Is he off his meds?  You stopped taking those little white pills when it became clear the damned things were cramping your style.  But Danny is always so careful with his schedules.  Danny obeys the doctor's prescription pad.  \\n\\nDanny is not focusing.  \"There!\"  He points down the hall.  \"Do you see that?!\"\\n\\n\"What?\"  You see a sickening slaughter going down, a lot of blood, bla bla bla.\\n\\n\"Someone has looted the druid dagger!  The one I wanted to liberate!\"\\n\\nUh-oh.  \"Yeah, that sucks like the rest of our evening.  Let it go.\"\\n\\n\"I see him again.\"  He takes a slow step away form you, then another, picking up speed.  \"I'm going to get that dagger.  You appropriate a getaway car.\"\\n\\n\"You can't be serious!\" you shout after him.  But he is serious.  He sprints straight into the mess of people.\\n\\nHe's dangerously close to a berserk, absolutely bloodsoaked, heavily muscled vampire with blonde hair and an 'R' tattooed on his shoulder. \\n\\n\"Ralon!\" a man shouts at him.  \"Your reign of horror ends tonight!\"\\n\\n\"You think that dagger can stop me?!\"\\n\\nThat's your cue to leave.  Danny will catch up.  You reach for the door - it's hanging crookedly on the hinges - and one of the vampires on the floor that you thought was dead grabs your ankle and trips you.  You go headfirst into the wall, cursing your bad choices on the way down.  It all goes dark.\\n\\nYou come to.  That's a surprise, you were so sure you were a goner.  The vamp that had tripped you is dead; it must have been on it's last, crawling attempt at murder.  \\n\\nIt's quieter now.  How long were you out?  But it's not too late to flee.  You open the door a crack.  Danny's out there!  He looks sick and has a bandage over his palm.  \"Matthias,\" he says, his voice slurred, \"Ralon is gone.  We've gotta get out of here.\"\\n\\nMatthias scowls, flashing his fangs.  He's thin as a wire, wearing a blood splattered suit that sets off his dark hair and grey-green eyes nicely.  He has a black, awful looking wound on his neck.  He points at the door where you're lurking.  \"Come out and join us, human.\"\\n\\n[[B27]]\\nYou come out and join the party.\\n",

Thank god for lazy security guards needing to rest their feet! \\n\\nYou pick it up, examine it.  It's one of those incredibly poorly constructed, ten dollar wonder, folding chairs that you have broken your fair share of by trying to stand on when you're trying to reach Danny's ten-year-old scotch, hidden on the top shelf of the pantry.  \\n\\nOh, poor gullible Danny, believing having the booze eight feet up would keep you from it ...\\n\\nThis chair isn't any better made than the others.  You swing it hard against the wall and it smashes into bits, leaving you with two usable stakes.  \\n\\nThat's what mama's talking about.  You head to the door, and the vampire's ... gone.\\n\\nHuh.  Disappointing.  You walk toward the still-twitching body of the blonde and decide not to frisk it.  No time to waste, and her dress was too tight to be hiding a wallet, anyway.\\n\\nThe vampire grabs you from behind.  Shit, you hate it when the smarter perverts get sneaky.  You flail but can't get free.  The vamp tears your purse off and throws it out of sight.  Suddenly, your anger overpowers your fear.  You scratch at the vamp's eyes, and it flinches back.  You've got just enough leverage to shove the stake into its abdomen, tip aimed upward.\\n\\nThe vamp squeals and falls backwards.  Blood shoots out from the wound like red water through a high-pressure hose, spattering your white blazer with a brand-new Pollock print.  \\n\\nYou remind yourself your jacket's reversible, walk up to the thrashing vamp, and kick the bottom of the stake.  The wood bruises your foot through your flats but you manage to shove it through the vampire's heart.  \\n\\nIt arches its back and smoke rushes from it's open mouth, fire licks up from the stake, and it burns.  It's a slower death than Matthias's stolen knife, but it does the trick.\\n\\nYou clutch your stake close had hurry to the staircase.  There's three more bodies here, already eaten, and fresh ash drifting in the air.  Downstairs, you see more people running, more vampires leaping.  Unfortunately, that's where you have to go.  \\n\\nYou reach the bottom of the stairs, grip your last stake tightly, and look around.  \\n\\nTo your right is the end of the hall with the buffet table, where Danny said he'd be.  You see at least half a dozen of the vampires in security uniforms, hunting.  You remember from the programme map that wing also has the gift shop, and a doorway to the parking lot.  \\n\\nTo your left you hear that unmistakable sizzle of Matthias's knife in action - it sounds like there's a big brawl just pass where the hall turns a corner.  Unfortunately, that's also the way to the front doors. \\n\\n[[B15]]\\nThis seems like a good time to team up with Danny.  Strength in numbers, right?\\n\\n[[B16]]\\nOtherwise, Matthias seemed at least a little concerned with your safety.  He might be willing to do you a solid and clear a path to the front door.\\n",

It's the vampire that was feeding on the blonde - guess she wasn't a juicy satisfying meal so it's moving to the next human.  It gives a guttural growl, blood and tendons hanging from its jaws, snaps at you.  You struggle to throw it off, fumbling around you, looking for anything that could be a weapon.\\n\\nMatthias is standing over you.  He's suddenly just there - how the hell can he move this fast?  He pulls the vamp off and breaks its back over his knee.  He tosses it aside, grimaces at the globs of sticky black rot staining the leg of his pants, and turns back to the pierced guy and the bottle blonde.\\n\\nThe man with the piercings fires the crossbow.  You gasp - but no, Matthias didn't get it in his chest.  He'd caught the crossbow bolt the hard way - through his forearm.  He pulls it out, throws the bolt aside, and lunges for the vamps.  \\n\\nMama didn't raise a fool.  You scramble to your feet and arm yourself with the bolt.  None too soon - the blonde has gotten past Matthias and you turn in the nick of time and stake her.\\n\\nShe drops and you step over her death rattle, looking in the hallway.  No sign of the bruiser, just a cloud of ash and a handful of metal studs tinkling as they rolled down the staircase.  \\n\\nMatthias brushes ash off the front of his tweed coat, pretty much an empty gesture since he's caked with that and worse by now.  He offers you his arm and you walk down the staircase.\\n\\nAt the bottom of the staircase, Matthias freezes and cocks his head.\\n\\n[[B17]]\\nYou listen, and you hear something weird even by this night's standards ...",

Me.\"  Matthias brandishes his dagger, wiggling it so the light of the overhead chandelier dances off the blade.\\n\\nYou step over the mangled human bodies, and between the waiting vampires.  They shudder as you walk by but hold position, eyes fixed on Ralon.\\n\\nRalon and Matthias are as different as night and day, and yet ...\\n\\nRalon is taller, body ropy with muscle instead of Matthias's trim and slim frame.  He's wearing a ripped, sleeveless shirt and low slung black jeans instead of a neat suit.  He's tattooed with an 'R' on his shoulder instead of Matthias's perfect porcelain skin. \\n\\nSomething's off.  Something's niggling at the corner of your mind, and you can't tell what.

And his skin, like all the vampire's, is pale as death.  White as Matthias's, actually ...\\n\\nHe's dancing on the balls of his feet, twitching with manic energy.  You really wish you had a canister of mace, to treat him with.  Too bad it got confiscated at Heathrow airport.\\n\\n\"Here she comes,\" he crows.  He looks you up and down.  \"There's not much to you, now is there?\"  \\n\\nYou blink, and he's just there, in front of you.  He grabs the collar of your sheath and pulls you closer.  \"You smell fantastic.\"  He wiggles his eyebrows.\\n\\n\"Please respect my personal space,\" you manage.  Oh god, now you sound like Danny.\\n\\nThe vampire laughs and backs up a step.  \"Oh, Matthias.  Sometimes if I squint, I can almost understand what you see in them.  Especially this one.  And then I turn around and they're just so many cattle, wandering around, wasting their lives.  Eating, fucking, dying.\"\\n\\n\"Some of them are extraordinary,\" Matthias said softly.  \"They manage things we cannot.  For instance, they recovered this, just in time for me to stop your latest atrocity.\"  He turns the dagger so it shines in the light.\\n\\n\"Drama queen.  This is just the latest move in our little game of survival.  I knew, when I saw that article in the papers, that you'd come for the dagger.  So I raised a little army.  Go ahead and kill my spawn.  I can make more.  Humans are everywhere in this decade, they're crawling like rats.\"\\n\\n\"Why don't you let the girl leave, send those poor creatures you've doomed to die quietly, and you and I can settle this in the old way.\"\\n\\n\"A duel?  No, I prefer the older way.  Remember the Thirty Years' War?  Rival lords used to slaughter each other's villages to make a point.  It's no different these nights.  Villages tend to be ten thousand or more people, so it will take me a little longer-\"\\n\\nMatthias snarls, and his canines extend into two fangs.\\n\\nYou can't say you're surprised.  Just disappointed.  Because now you don't have any allies here to trust.\\n\\n\"So you wanna play rough?  I'm game.  Grab her-\" he says to his minions.\\n\\nYou flinch and try to run, but it's too late.  A vampire grabs your arms, pins them behind your back.  Your skin crawls at their ice-cold flesh, the bloodreeking breath puffing against your cheek.\\n\\nUnder the smell of blood, you think you recognize that perfume.  You roll your head back and see ...\\n\\nMisha.  A wound a her neck and dry blood flaking off her skin.  Her eyes, as red as any of the other feral vampire, dart back and forth between Ralon and his rival.\\n\\nMatthias grimaces, a muscle jumping in his cheek.\\n\\n\"Surrender to me,\" Ralon says, \"and I'll let the girl live.  I'll let her walk out the front door without a mark on her.  Or I' can have my minions rip her to a thousand screaming pieces.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" Matthias said softly.\\n\"Oh really?\" Ralon raises his eyebrows.  \"And yo u claim to love humans so.\"\\n\\n\"Her death is regrettable, but for the best cause.  That would be me, carving out your black, withered heart.\"\\n\\n\"Guys?\" you put in.  \"I don't want to be part of this cause.\"\\n\\nRalon smirks at you.  \"Too late for that, pet.  Now, Matthias, show me what you've got.  But I warn you, I've got a little surprise for-\"\\n\\nMatthias buries the dagger to the hilt in Ralon's stomach.  Ralon coughs up a spray of blood and staggers away, and the tip of the dagger breaks off.  The closer vampires rush forward, fall to their knees licking it off the floor.\\n\\n\"Little help here,\" you say.\\n\\nMatthias doesn\u2019t seem to hear you.  He clears the distance to Ralon in one leap and straddles him, raising the dagger for another blow.  Ralon writhes like a snake and shoves his fingers into Matthias's shoulders, literally into the flesh, digging in with red fore dripping over his wrists, and he bites Matthias on the meat where neck meets shoulder and the vampire tears away, clutching the wound.  You see something black spreading along his veins.\\n\\n\"Minions!\" Ralon gags on blood and tries again.  \"Attack!\"\\n\\nDanny scrabbles to his feet and points at the front door.  \"Run for it!\" he shouts at you.  You dash, slipping in lagoons of blood, for the supposed safety of the doorway.\\n\\nRalon is wheezing, shaking, and you see something like fear in his eyes.  He looks at Danny, eyes fixing on his jugular.  Danny changes direction and gets to Matthias's side.  HE tries to snatch the dagger, and then falls back screaming and clutching his bloody palm to his stomach.\\n\\nRalon staggers outside, rushing through the glass.  Misha follows with a half dozen minions, the other vampires circle closer, hunger in their faces.\\n\\nThe front door's off limits now, so you come back and drop to your knees by Danny who is convulsing on the ground, gasping for breath.  His skin is turning grey.\\n\\nBehind you, the larval vampires are rushing at Matthias.  He's sweating blood, disoriented.  He lashes out with the dagger, stabs the nearest vamps.  Some of the others flee back down the hall.  Two continue at him.\\n  \\n[[B19]]\\nAre you going to try to help Danny, if there's anything that can be done? \\n\\n[[B20]]\\nMaybe you should go to Matthias, help him in the hopes he'll protect you ... or at least get close enough to liberate that what's left of the dagger.\\n",

      "text": "You shove the heart down your neckline and it immediately lets go of your wrist and burrows down, between your breasts, under your bra.  You feel a single moment of tearing pain and scream in shock, falling to your knees-\\n\\n\\nThe pain stops.  You feel heat instead, spreading through your body. You look down, see blood drizzling down from the new hole in your chest.  Then it seems to turn darker red, thickening like chocolate syrup, before it stops falling.\\n\\n\\nYou writhe in pleasure.  Every beat of the new heart is so much stronger than your old, human one.  Your body rings like a bell to it.\\n\\n\\n\"How dare you?\"  Sadora's voice is so calm.  A human would have been terrified of that composed tone, so different from the rage one expects.  \\n\\n\\nYou aren't human anymore.  You walk over to her and pull down the neckline of your blouse, showing her the heart that's burrowed into your chest.  \\n\\n\\nHer too-still expression cracks for just an instant.  With your extraordinarily enhanced senses you see the details a human or a lesser vampire would miss, the milliseconds of her eyes widening and unfocusing, her body drawing back as she unconsciously tenses up to attack you.  But she's distracted, disoriented with grief, and you've never felt better.\\n\\n\\nYou reach into her chest and pluck out her heart.  \\n\\n\\nShe thrashes and arches her back as if her spine is breaking.  Her rib cage splits open, skin peeling back and ribs spreading wide like the slices of an orange.  Black, bubbling ichor drips from her and then she bursts into flame, then turns to a plume of ash that drifts in the mysterious air currents that wind through the catacombs. \\n\\n\\n\\nYou take a few steps back and look at the creature in your hands.  There it is.  A true Vampire Heart.  It holds a cure for one of your friends ... or the key to so much power for one lucky companion.  But how, how can you choose between them?\\n\\n\\nThe clay jar you just opened is ready at your feet.  You drop the new heart in and close it.\\n\\n\\n\"What have you done?\" Matthias whispers.  \\n\\n\\nHe's frozen, staring at you, ignoring the water lapping at his thighs, covered in a scum of suspended vampire ash.  \\n\\n\\nMatthias is heedless of the mess.  He stares at you, lost, betrayed.  \"Abomination,\" he whispers.  He swallows and blinks rapidly.  \"How could you sacrifice your humanity, your precious life, like this.\"  He sucks in a deep breath and reaches into his pocket.  \"Abomination,\" he says again, voice steadier.\\n\\n\\nThe heart that is in you has gorged on your blood and is strong, stronger that Matthias's.  You can hear his still weakened, only half healed heart beating erratically. You see the way his hand shakes as he - seemingly in slow motion- raises his stake.  \\n\\n\\nHe is weak.  He is still tainted with traces of venom.  You could embrace him close, use your potent heart blood to speed his healing.  You could put him in your power. \\n\\n\\nBut you won't.\\n\\n\\nYou smile, flashing your new fangs.  And you dart around him.  He is fast but you are a Maker, you were reborn to be faster, and you drag his head backwards, down onto your shoulder.  You are much shorter than him and pulling his head down bares his neck, a tempting arch of smooth white skin. \\n\\n\\nYou rip his throat open, tearing out part of his spine in the process.  Blood fountains up, high enough to hit the ceiling a dozen feet up.  You reach into his chest, pull out that half-withered excuse for a heart, and stand there, watching him burn.\\n\\n\\n\"Bitch,\" Ralon says.\\n\\n\\nYou turn and look at him.  \"Oh really?  You've hated Matthias, fought him for years.  So you're welcome.\"  Jesus.  You did what he wasn't able to, and this is the thanks you get.\\n\\n\\nRalon flashes his teeth.  It is not a smile.  He walks closer and wipes his fingers over your chin, then sucks them in his mouth.  Tasting the last essence of his on-again-off-again lover.\\n\\n\\n\"He was mine.  Mine to kill, or not, as  I please.\"  Ralon feints a blow for your throat and your blood kicks in again and he's so slow, you have all the time in the world to notice his other hand sneaking forward in a crushing blow aimed for your chest.  You feel your inhuman heart curl to the side as if it feels the blow coming and is trying to avoid it.  It's child's play to dodge around and rip his arm off.  Then you take his heart out too, and let his ashes mix with Matthias's.  Those two are together for the final time, for eternity.  \\n\\n\\nYou turn to Misha and Danny.  There's no time to waste, and you have work to do.  You swore you would save them both ... so different, but utterly loyal to you.  You have a little gift for them.   \\n\\n\\nYou turn them into vampires, as the only way to save their lives, and keep the other heart close as you leave the damn castle, never to return.  Misha and Danny take quite well to being vampires, after a few ... early issues that you smooth over with your more powerful glamour.  They are much unhappier when you explain why you will never give them the Heart, but you know one day they will adjust to it.  You love them equally and refuse to play favorites.  \\n\\n\\nLove.  Yes, you do.  Your heart swells with emotions, dark and bitter and intense, and the only pure thing left in your new life of blood-soaked hedonism is your bond with those two.\\n\\n\\nThe three of you are happy for over a decade.  You fight and hunt and go to all the best parties and do as you please, go where you please.  Other vampires learn to avoid you when you come near, and that suits you just fine.  You feel a dark, gloating, greedy joy as you dream of an eternity together.  Your human life, your dreams of college and a career, fade into the distance.\\n\\n\\nOne summer, you go to Russia.  The place is lousy with vampire hunters.  They're a constant nuisance.  You think this is the same organization that has been following you from Paris, from Johannesburg, from cities before that.  It's probably because of some ... rash decisions you made while looking for a good time, but what of it?  The three of you are invincible.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, vampires are not the only supernatural creatures in the world.  You're reminded of that the hard way, when you wake up one sunset and can\u2019t move.\\n\\n\\nDanny pulls your eyelids back and leans into your field of vision. \\n\\n\\n\"Now, don't glare.  This will only take a minute.\"\\n\\n\\nYou can barely see Misha out of the corner of your eye.  She cuts open your shirt.  \"You didn't leave us a choice.  Expecting us to live in this miserable pain.  You won't give us the heart so now we have to take it.  And yours, too.\"\\n\\n\\n\"It's completely logical, if you think about it,\" Danny says, brushing your hair from your face.  \"The witch who sold us this paralytic potion explained how to remove your heart without killing you.  I'll get one, and Misha will get the other, and you'll still be a vampire.  Just ... lesser.  Like we are now.\"\\n\\n\\n\"You brought this on yourself,\" Misha says, lifting the broken dagger you still carry.  \"Those hunters almost got us in Paris.  One Maker isn't enough to hold them back forever.  But now there will be two Makers, and we'll take care of you.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Of course we will,\" Danny said.  He pats your cheek.  \"We love you, and the three of us are going to be very, very happy.\"\\n\\n\\nMisha plunges the knife into your chest.  They rip out your heart and put a sack of herbs in the cavity, just like the witch instructed.\\n\\n\\nThe witch lied to them.\\n\\n\\nYou can't even scream, as all your warmth, all your vitality drains away.  Flames start at your fingers and toes, racing along your body.  Misha howls in loss and rage and throws water over you, but it turns to steam before it can hit the flames.  Danny, face white with horror, tries to shove the heart back in, but it clings to his hands. \\n\\n\\nYou always believed it was better to burn out than to fade away, and you get your wish.  With your last thought you hope Danny and Misha avenge you, kill that witch in the bloodiest way they can revise.  But you\u2019re disappointed you won't be around to see it.\\n\\n\\nTHE END \\n\\n[[L2]]\\nRestart the chapter?\\n\\n\\n[[Start]]\\nRestart from the beginning?\\n",

There's a ten-gallon bag with a hose and showerhead attachment hanging in one corner over a plastic basin.  You assume that's his makeshift shower.  There is also a yoga mat with a pillow in the other corner.  Next to it is a couple shopping bags from a higher-end men's clothing store.  To one side of the door is an ice cooler, and the opposite wall is half hidden behind a makeshift bookcase of wooden planks on concrete blocks.

What's so different about Misha?\"\\n\\n\"Ralon and I are Fallen Vampires, which is a term for those turned by a Maker, or High Vampire, but not transformed completely into a new creature.  That final transformation happens when a vampire possesses a True Vampire Heart, but our Maker chose not to give either of us one.  We have many advantages over humans, the most important being our theoretical immortality.  Because our veins pulse with blood from one of the sources of vampirism, we are stronger than the death that has seeped into every cell.  That is how we can last for so long; death itself is stopped by heartblood.\"\\n\\n\"But Ralon gave Misha some of his blood, right?  I mean, isn't that how vampires are made?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.  Unfortunately, Fallen vampires are still half-human, still limited.  When we turn someone, we cannot pass on potent enough blood to keep our victims alive ... in the sense that any vampire is 'alive'.  Death sweeps along every cell, and these larval vampires sense they are too weak to fight it off.  They go berserk with bloodlust, but no matter that they drain ten or a hundred humans, they will not stave off death for long.  They rot from within, in mere hours to a few days.\"\\n\\n\"Jesus Christ. So Ralon did this, knowing these vampires all have an expiration date?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.  Just another depravity I have added to his list of crimes.\"\\n\\n\"Isn't there something we can do to help her?\"\\n\"Perhaps.  I will have to think on this matter.\"\\n\\n[[C4]]\\nDo you want to ask what happened to Danny?\\n\\n[[C5]]\\nMaybe you want the real deal on the grudge between Matthias and Ralon?\\n\\n[[C10]]\\nYou need a plan to get out of this situation!\\n",

I know he got nicked by that dagger, but he didn't burst into flames or anything ...\"\\n\\n\"He is dying,\" Matthias says softly.  \"I don't fully understand the arcane specifics, but that dagger was long ago imbued with the blood of a High Vampire Heart, and now it has vampiric qualities.  It strips life force away.  Minions like the ones Ralon brought to his side have so little life force that any blow from the dagger is instantly fatal.  Humans are more robust, but they, too, will die within one to three days.  They weaken, they lose their sanity, and finally their hearts stop.\"\\n\\n\"How long does Danny have?\"\\n\\n\"He's sickening quickly.

He's behind Ralon, having grabbed the taller vamp in a choke hold.\\n\\n\\n\"Promises, promises,\" Ralon grits.  He throws Matthias over his shoulder, slamming him into the ground with real force.  \"You'd be lost without me.  Our vendetta is the only reason either of us gets up in the morning.\"\\n\\n\\nHe seems to have a nice villainous rant geared up, but it cuts off.  You savor the look of uncomprehending shock on his face as Misha stakes him.\\n\\n\\nMatthias leans back on his elbows and stares expressionlessly as his former lover goes up in flames.  He turns his face up to the ash falling in the air, and closes his eyes.\\n\\n\\nYou toss Danny a stake, and he rams it into Matthias\u2019s chest.  The bereaved vampire doesn\u2019t twitch as the fire consumes him.  You wonder, idly, if he'd heard Danny coming up.  Maybe he'd wanted to die.  Maybe Ralon was right, without the hatred there was no reason to go on.\\n\\n\\nMisha, Danny, and you share a group hug over the ashes of those three dead vamps.  It's been a hell of a day, and most people would take the first flight back to the United States, back to your normal lives.  But these last three kills changed something in you.  Beer pong will never be enough again, to hell with history class ... you've got the bloodlust now.  Not a vampire's thirst.  You've changed into a more dangerous predator.\\n\\n\\nYou're hunters now, and you know you were born to kill these motherfuckers.\\n\\n\\nDanny's research pinpoints a maker in Reykjavik.  Between the three of you, it's easy to juice this one.  You take the cure this time and join Misha and Danny as an equal partner in your triad of terror.  After a few glorious months of murder and mayhem, you find the effects of the doses are fading.  You get some info from a coven of witches, and some cool magical tattoos that help you kill their ancestral enemies ... then you track down more makers, juice them.  The three of you are a rock solid team and hey, there are a lot of vamps in the world.  \\n\\n\\nYou revel in your new lives.  Permanently healthy, recovering quickly, strong and fast and keen senses, and as long as the heart blood keeps coming, you don't age.  All the advantages of being a vampire without the compulsion to kill.  Well, you do love killing.  And you crave the cure ... it's different from a vampire's bloodlust, okay?  You have more refined tastes than the leeches.  \\n\\n\\nThis  won't last forever.  Someday your luck will turn, someday one of you will make a mistake, hell, maybe a Maker will get a one-in-a-million shot in and finish you.  Eventually you'll run out of hearts to hunt and the crazy train will run to ground but you remind yourself that nothing lasts forever, and you're having one hell of a ride.\\n\\n\\nTHE END.\\n\\n[[L1]]\\nRestart the chapter?\\n\\n\\n[[Start]]\\nRestart from the beginning?\\n",

Matthias gasps and dodges, barely fast enough to avoid the blow.  A few severed shreds of his coat drift in the air.\\n\\nYou turn around in a fast circle, looking for a weapon, an angle.

You can pull this off.  \\nYou close your eyes and try to visualize some sexy music.  All that comes up in your memory is Deadfalls' 'Ode to the beautiful backstabbing bitch I married.'  You've never known what the lyrics are - it's five minutes of the lead singer roaring his best death-metal rumble into the microphone- but it has a pretty good baseline.\\n\\n\"Get ready!\" you warn her.\\n\\nShe arches her thin, inky brows.\\n\\nYou start off by twisting enthusiastically through the torso and pumping your arms.  It remind you of being on the elliptical at the school gym ... that's not sexy.  You should stop. You switch to wiggling in a circle, pretending you've got a hula hoop around your waist.  And you almost lose your balance in those damn heels.  You try to shimmy but you weren't blessed with enough chest to shake at her. \\n\\n\"Whoo yeah!\"  Maybe if you shout loudly enough, she won't notice that you're a horrible dancer ...\\n\\nYou turn around and try twerking ... but your small, moderately flat booty is not cooperating.   \"Oh baby!\"  You attempt to bump and grind, and almost topple over again.  Maybe you should lose the fucking shoes ... but then your bare skin would touch the floor.  There's no telling what's been on that floor.\\n\\nYou face her again.  She has frozen in place, her eyes wide.  You put your hands behind your head and gyrate, touch your hips and gyrate, hug yourself and gyrate - ohfuckno, that's the Macarena!  The least sexy of the Latin dances!  \\n\\nFor the big finale, you pull out a couple sweet disco moves, pointing between ceiling and floor with some hip thrusts thrown in.  Your skirt has ridden up and given that she's sitting down, you're pretty sure she can see your panties.  Who knows, that may tip the balance in your favor.  \\n\\nYou back toward her, popping your petite butt in her direction, then spin around and fall to your knees, trying to rip your shirt open.

The Maker's blood changes you, freezes something deep inside.  \\n\\n\\nYour empty.  Your chest feels hollow.  You open your eyes to your first night as a vampire and realize ... something's missing.  Something's incomplete.  That's the only pain you feel anymore, and it consumes you.  You force it deep down, try to focus on something else.  You open your eyes and sit up.\\n\\n\\n\"There's my brave little girl,\" your Maker whispers.  Her radiant smile fills your whole world; you shudder at the emotion, the overwhelming desire to keep her approval, to please her ... your heart burns with cold fire, with the desire to follow every order.  She gently wipes the blood from your mouth with the tattered hem of her nightgown.  \"This evening was so disappointing until I made you.  Your brothers have not behaved but I shall give them another chance.  Help me throw them out?\"\\n\\n\\nChild's play.  With the heady strength surging in your veins, you have no trouble pinning Matthias, who is debilitated by the wounds of his latest fight with Ralon.  You hold him until your Maker creates some new, potent simulacra to toss him out.  She sics hellhounds on Ralon.  You  watch them chase him from the catacombs ... weakened, he barely outruns them.  Now that's almost funny.  You smirk as your Maker gives Matthias the same treatment, but it is a reflex; your emotions are dulled, closed in a layer of black ice.\\n\\n\\nYou friends die that dawn, and you barely notice.  In life, you missed goldfish more than you miss them.  It doesn't matter, nothing matters but your Maker.  She gave you half a gift and if you can somehow please her enough ... maybe she will give you more.  The heart, the True Vampire Heart - that's what you crave.  That's what will make you whole again.\\n\\n\\nYears pass.  You dare not leave your Maker's side.  You're weakened without a true Heart, always half crazed with thirst, unable to think clearly.  Many of the victims you lure in from the neighboring hiking paths and villages are killed to feed the second heart ... the one denied you.  You get the dregs from their bodies, and it isn't enough, but you can't disappoint your Maker so you drink it and survive.  Barely.\\n\\n\\nOne night in the spring finds you waiting outside a pub.  You'd slipped a note into the pocket of a likely looking idiot.  He's drunk and well over six feet of muscle ... you think he must have a lot of blood, more than enough for your Maker and the second heart.  Maybe enough for a proper meal, instead of just a taste ...\\n\\n\\n\"Hey, beautiful, wanna go Dutch on the next meal?\"\\n\\n\\nIt's Ralon.  You raise an eyebrow at him.  \"Forget it.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Aww c'mon.  I saw you in there, working on that guy.  Big man like that's got more than enough for us to share.\"\\n\\n\\nYour eye twitches.  Half the blood, half ... you've never once fed that deeply.  It must be nice ... but no, Maker gave her orders.  \"No can do.\"\\n\\n\\nMatthias steps around the corner.  \"I know the three of us parted on bad terms, but can't we break bread, as it were?  Eternity is too long to nurse a grudge.\"\\n\\n\\n\"So you two have made up now?\"  My oh my, unlife does move around in circles.\\n\\n\\n\"We found some common ground.\"  Matthias rests his hand on your shoulder.  \"Please.  Let us share him, and then Ralon and I will help you hunt another for our Maker.\"\\n\\n\\n\"She ... it's forbidden.  I don't feed, unless it's from a body she gives me.\"  The orders were clear.  Deep down, you wish you had the strength of will to defy her.  But that part was frozen with the rest of your emotions, far out of reach.\\n\\n\\nRalon leaned close and breathed in your ear, \"It'll be our dirty little secret.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I can't.  I can't.\"\\n\\n\\nMatthias suddenly grabs you and pins your arms behind your back.  You're strong as a vampire, but this time around' he's well fed and overpowers you easily.  You hiss at him.\\n\\n\\nHe sighs.  \"You were right, Ralon.  She's completely in thrall.\"\\n\\n\\nRalon shrugs.  \"Told ya.\"  He cups your cheek.  \"Our maker's kept you under the wing for twelve years.  Matthias and I got ... five?  Then she got bored, told us to kill each other for her amusement and she'd consider just maybe handing over the heart ... and the bitch threw us out.  I think she's got a soft spot for you.\"\\n\\n\\nHe reaches into his bomber jacket and pulls out a stake.\\n\\n\\n\"You can't be serious.  I haven't done anything to either of you!\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yet.\"  Matthew tightens his grip on your wrists.  \"But our maker cares about you, too much.  We think you're her favorite, and it's only a matter of time before she gives you the heart.  Then we'll be trapped like this, half human and half something else, denied our dreams forever.  It's unacceptable.\"\\n\\n\\nYour dead heart beats a little faster.  You've almost earned the heart, almost - but then your eyes fall on the stake.  \"So what is this, you guys are afraid of a little competition?  You're jealous?\"  It's so ridiculous.  This is the reason they set aside their centuries-long vendetta - to kill you?!\\n\\n\\n\"Sorry, beautiful.  I like you, so does he though he won't admit it.  But eternity is too long to live without the hope of a better life.  You've gotta go.\"\\n\\n\\nHe plunges the stake into your chest.  You choke out blood, a vast gush of it, which spatters Ralon's face in red.  Matthias cradles you in his arms as you shudder.  The ice that's encased your heart melts and you feel, for the first time in years ... absolute terror.  Just before the flames eat you away, you see Ralon lick your blood from his lips.\\n\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n[[L1]]\\nRestart the chapter?\\n\\n\\n[[Start]]\\nRestart from the beginning?\\n\\n\\n",

And you're uncomfortably aware of being the only human in snacking range.  \\n\\nA larval vamp, his skin literally swollen with blood, rises from the nearby feast of two schoolgirls in kilts and stalks closer.  \\n\\n\"I told you to kill that man,\" Ralon slurrs, pointing in Matthias's direction.  He staggers for the wall and reaches out, swats at it.

Long, curly blonde hair, now red with blood ... it's Misha.  She's got a fresh bite mark seeping red down her neck, and her eyes have gone feral-vampire-red.  \\n\\n\"What is this?  Did you do that?\"\\n\\nHe glances where you're pointing.  \"Stacks?  Yeah, I turned her.

He supports Matthias as they back away.\\n\\nRalon growls as they slip out of sight.\\n\\nAnd that's it.  You're done with this.  You turn to run, make it three steps - and a cold hand closes like a vice around the back of your neck.\\n\\n\"Where are you off too?\" Ralon asks, his cold, blood-reeking breath curling against your cheek.  \"I like to have someone to talk to when I'm planning revenge.\"\\n\\n[[A27]]\\nWell, it's not like you have much choice right now.\\n",

The odds keep getting worse and you shudder, but there's no way you can struggle free of his strength.\\n\\nThere's a few more new vampires lurking by the entrance; they wait in a semicircle near the parking lot.  Ralon drops you off with them.  They're milling around like highstrung animals, jerking at every noise, stopping every so often to sniff the air.  Most of them seem well beyond any kind of speech.  They all start to edge closer, hungry eyes on you.\\n\\n\"Don't bite her, that's an order.  You've had enough humans tonight.\" Ralon sounds distracted.  He pulls a pair of keys from his pocket. \"Stacks, hold onto her while I get us a ride.\"  \\n\\nMisha sidles over.  She looks even worse up close ... blood smeared all over her face and neck, down the unnatural white of her skin and into her ample cleavage that is barely held in her favorite laceup leather vest, and her eyes are rabid red like the others here.  \\n\\nSHe grabs your arm tightly and sniffs at your shoulder.\\n\\n\"Misha, it's me,\" you whisper.\\n\\nShe tilts her head and licks her fangs.  You look in her eyes and ... nobody's home.\\n\\nYou have no chance of breaking free of this lot, so you huddle up, wishing you were warmer but you are after all soaking wet with blood, and wait.\\n\\nOne of the nearby vamps, a teenager with a blue mohawk, staggers and doubles over, hacking up black-streaked blood.  You see more of hte inky slime stuff run from his eyes and ears.  He clutches at the nearest vamp, an older man with a huge moustache.  Moustache man shoves him aside and the mohawk crumples against the overflowing dumpsters near the entrance, retches once more, and curls up.  He dies right in front of you.\\n\\nThere's something seriously wrong with these things.\\n\\nRalon drives up in a beat-up van that says 'Ee-zee Plumb-r' on the side.  He hops out and goes straight to you, roughly pushes your sleves up, your neckline down, runs his calloused fingers over your largely unbroken skin.  \\n\\n\"So I see nobody chewed on the toy.  Just like I ordered.\"  His smirk fades and he looks almost regretful.  \"You are an obedient batch.\"  The two vamps he sent out return.  \"Any sign of him or his gamoured minion?  Smell anything?\" \\n\\nA vamp hisses at him.  \\n\\nHe shrugs and swings you around, holding you tightly from behind in a parody of a boyfriend's embrace.  \"Oh Matthias, I have a helpless litle human right here.  She's ever so warm and brave and alive.  But that can change any second.\"\\n\\nYou stand there, listening to the silence.  Nothing.  Off in the distance, faintly, a siren starts up.\\n\\n\"Hm.  Well, it was worth a shot.  I thought the way you look, the way he watched you, maybe you meant something.\"  He purrs into your ear, \"Maybe I was wrong and you really are just another bag of meat.\"\\n\\nTHis bastard has helped kill one of your best friends, and you won't give him the satisfaction of begging.  \"Go fuck yourself.\"  You square your chin and wait for the attack.\\n\\nRalon laughs and lets you go.  \"Not tonight.  C'mon.\" \\n\\nHe rolls open the side door, whistles and points.  His pack of larval vampires crawl in and settle down inside, their eyes reflecting the light in nightmare red sparks in the darkness.  \\n\\nHe rolls the door shut firmly, shoves you into the passenger seat up front, and takes off.\\n\\n\"You're crashing with me tonight.\" He smirks.\\n\\n[[D1]]\\nYou've never seen a vampire's lair before ... but how bad, realistically, could it be?

Obedient, loyal minions.\"  His smile turns down at one corner.  he takes a deep breath and looks around.  \"Matthias!  Look who I've dug up!\"  Ralon grabs you by the nape of your neck ahd walks you in a semicircle, showing you off like a prizewinning fish he'd cuaght.  \"She's so brave, so alive... for now.  Come out with your new glamoured servant and I'll be too distracted to kill her!\"\\n\\nNothing.  Just silence and, in the distance, sirens.  Finally, somebody called the cops.  Not that they'll get here in time for you.\\n\\n\"Eh, worth a shot.

You tense, expecting an attack.  Instead, he laughs.  \"Nice.  What a reckless little girl.\"  He glances around and asks his vamps, \"You smell anyone?  You hear Matthias or his glamoured human?\"\\n\\nThey shift uneasily.  Ralon shrugs, then winces and touches the wound in his side.  \"Eh.  It was a long shot.\\n\\nRalon opens the side door, whistles and points.  THe vampis pile in nad settle down, crouching like animals, eyes glinting red in the darkness.

YOU assume they failed.\\n\\nThe light through the stained glass windows dims until you can barely see the outlines of the boys. \\n\\n\"The floor's changing,\" Matthias says.\\n\\n\"Oh god no,\" you say sarcastically.  You'll start panicking if or more accurately when a horde of animated skeletons attacks.  \\n\\n\"Why are my feet wet?\"  water is lapping against your shoes and you can smell the faintly murky scent of the Loch.  \"Oh god, are we going to drown?\"  Maybe you do have a little panic left over.\\n\\n\"The floor is flooding.\"  You hear Matthias splash and vaguely see him bend down and straighten.  \"There's an underwater passage here and water is spilling over from it.\"\\n\\n\"The room's trying to drown us!

I suspect the only reason we haven't been attacked already is that this was an attack of opportunity, instead of a coordinated effort by her minions to drive the hapless humans into the trap.\"\\n\\nThat's bad news.  There is literally no furniture to hide behind, nothing to make into a weapon unless the 'something aquatic' is for some reason killed by flying urns.  You can't stay here-\\n\\nOh hell.  \"You want us to dive into that creepy underwater passage and hope we don't drown before we reach the other side.\"\\n\\nMatthias grabs your arm.  Damn.  He managed to cross the room, in ankle deep water, without making a sound.\\n\\n\"Don\u2019t' worry, little humans.\"  You see he has dragged Danny close.  \"I will help when your strength fails.  Breathe in.\"\\n\\nYou suck in a breath and he shoves you and Danny under the surface, and keeps shoving until the dim red glow of the mausoleum vanishes behind you.  He releases you and you flail as you struggle to swim along this passage.  It's narrow enough you bash your elbows against the walls, or Danny, several times.  Just when you think your lungs will give out and you'll have to breathe in, even though you know there's no air and that would be suicide -\\n\\nMatthias shoves you in the back, and you exhale in shock and are propelled the last few feet to the surface in an explosion of bubbles.\\nYou bash your knees on a staircase that leads into the water and crawl the few feet up to the top.\\n\\n\"Ssssh,\" Matthias whispers to Danny.  He's holding the human close and staring into his eyes.  \"Let the pain fall away.  Let it drift from your mind.\"\\n\\nHe lifts Danny up and sets him on the top step.  Danny rubs his temples and moans.  He's bedraggled and shivering uncontrollably.\\nYou look around the enormous underground cavern you've swum into.  It's lit, faintly, by these glowing things that resemble tatters of cloth which wind in random patterns around the stalactites.  The stairs you are on connect to a pathway of smooth paving stones, which leads past the pebbly shore and the surface of the underground lake that takes up half the cavern.  That path leads through a far wall, which has a massive, screaming face carved into it.  The mouth forms the archway to whatever lies beyond.\\n\\nA distant thrummmmm cuts through the air, the tone making your skin crawl.\\n\\n\"It's an alarm,\" Matthias hisses.  \"Something's been alerted to us.  Something's coming to fetch the animals for its mistress.\"\\n\\nThe eyes of that carved face light up red as candles in them ignite.  They cast a malevolent light on an eight foot monster that shambles through the mouth and heads down the path toward you.  It looks kind of like an unwrapped mummy in leather armor, and it's armed with a scythe with a five foot blade.\\n\\n\"This will be challenging,\" Matthias says.  He looks intimidated.  \\n\\n[[E20]]\\n\\nSurely Matthias can handle this thing, with you and Danny playing backup?\\n\\n[[E21]]\\n\\nYou're not that confident Matthias will help the two of you, when he can use that superspeed to go around it and leave the humans behind as a distraction.

You curl up and try to unwrap what's caught you and the cloth slithers around your wrists too, pulling you deeper as even the faint light from the mouth of the oubliette goes out.  \\nThe currents move against your face - you're going sideways - and then suddenly you break the surface  and whatever had you lets go.\\n\\nYour lungs are burning and you're so weak you have to crawl up the gravel shore.  You collapse facedown, gag and cough up a mouthful of water and a little bit of hamburger, and finally look around.  \\nMore of those glowing, tattered things are drifting among the stalactites overhead and their light is giving enough of a glow that you can make out simple shapes. \\n\\nYou're in a vast cavern underground.  Here there's a lake that seems to disappear under the wall behind you.   You crawl forward off the gravel shore and onto smooth, tightly-fitting paving stones.  There's a path running down the center of the cavern ... it leads between what might be a staircase (you see two creepy looking statues over there but can't tell the details) and a wall cutting across the cavern from floor to roof.  The wall is carved to resemble a giant, screaming face, and the archway into whatever lies beyond is, of course, through the mouth.\\n\\nThe eyes of that face suddenly glow red.  There are candles set high in the walls and they've burst into flames.\\n\\nYou pull off your shoes, the pointy heels your only weapon, and get to your feet.  Something is coming.  You can see the shape moving through that screaming mouth, and you make out the silvery gleam of metal in its hands.\\n\\nThere\u2019s a splashing behind you form the pool where you emerge.  You scream - and stop screaming when you recognize Matthias and Danny.  Matthias manages to look brooding and composed despite the fact that his long hair is matted with weeds and his once very sharp suit is sopping wet and shapeless.  Danny looks like a miserable sheepdog that's gotten a bath and hasn't been towelled off.\\n\\nYou slip your shoes back on.  \"Sorry.  Get up here, quick.\"  They didn't leave you to die, eaten by monsters in an Oubliette.  you're a little choked up.  You shouldn\u2019t have doubted them.\\n\\n\"What is that?\" Danny asks.\\n\\nOh right.  Monsters at twelve o'clock.  YOU look back and see it's a mummified creature in leather armor.  With a scythe.\\n\"That is a flaw in the plan,\" Matthais says.  His voice is soft and uncertain.  \"The earth simulacrum that placed you in the Oubliette must have sent a warning down below, for them to expect fresh prey.  Mistress has dispatched something to bring her the animals.\"\\n\\nThis is the first time you've heard real fear in his voice.  If Matthias doesn't feel confident ... And that thing has straightened now that it has cleared the doorway.  It must be seven or eight feet tall, arms inhumanly long, and it carries one of the biggest blades you've ever seen.  That blade is at least five feet across.\\n\\n[[E20]]\\n\\nTwo humans and a vampire should be able to kill one of whatever it is.  Right?  You'll stay for the fight.\\n\\n[[E21]]\\n\\nTwo humans and a vampire without weapons don't have much chance of killing whatever it is.  It's time to strategically reposition yourself somewhere far, far away.\\n",

The standing stones shimmer white, burning against the red-orange sky that signals the coming of sunrise.  You haven't seen stone like this anywhere in Scotland and wonder how many miles it was dragged here.  Of course, evil things tend to come in pretty packages.  You notice each rock has been carved with well-worn runic symbols.\\n\\n\"Human-trapping spell?\" You ask Matthias and Danny.  \"Evil vampire baiting spell?  Gravestones?\"\\n\\nMatthias glances over them.  \"My runic is rusty, but these appear to be the names of constellations.\"\\n\\nOh.  Darn it.  You wander through the standing stones and kick a couple to be sure, but there's no sign of secret underground chambers.  \\nThe three of you turn back to the shepherd's cabin.\\n\\n\"What happened to that drunk guy in front?\" you ask.\\n\\nMatthias throws an arm out, stopping you and Danny.  \"I smell grave dirt.\"\\n\\nWhat?  \"Okay...\"\\n\\nHe points to the right.  \"I hear something there.  Come, and be quiet.\"  Matthias leads the way to behind some boulders, where you can peek out and look down the hill.\\n\\nThe lager fan is still unconscious, and he's being dragged by some kind of bent figure in a hooded cloak.  The hooded thing hauls him down the hill to where a lone standing stone has been placed near the treeline.  It grunts like an animal in effort as it heaves the human to the foot of the standing stone ... and instead of striking grass, the unfortunate man drops right through it, the earth melting away like a dream.  The hooded creature turns, puts its palms against the hillside, and sinks into it and vanishes.\\n\\nYou stare at the round, deep hole the human had been thrown into.  \"I guess we found our oubliette.\"  As you speak, the false grass grows back over it.  \\n\\n\"Mm.\"  Matthias doesn't sound happy.  \\n\\nYou hear an odd squeaking sound and look over, catching him grinding his teeth.\\n\\n\"Problem?\"  As far as you can tell, it's time to break out the climbing gear and rappel down.  It's a simple plan.  Not a good one, but simple.  \\n\\n\"I know of that cantrip.  It must be activated - or rather, deactivated, to allow someone through.\"\\n\\n\"So we need to trigger the secret door before it will open.  Shouldn't be an issue since you know that magic.\"\\n\\n\"I know OF the cantrip.  My own magical ability is close to nonexistent.\"\\n\\n\"Bummer.  What are we going to do now?\"\\n\\n\"I have an idea,\" he says softly.\\n\\n[[E15]]\\n\\nUh oh.  This sounds like the start of another terrible plan.  \\n",

The Oubliette may be disguised, somehow.\"  Matthias doesn't exactly sound very gung-ho about it.\\n\\nIf you want something done right ...\\n\\nYou march over to the edge of the hollow and throw some pebbles in.  The Loch Ness monster doesn't rise out of the murk to eat them, which is a plus.  You creep up to the edge and lean over, peering into the dark brown depths.

You miss your steel toed concert boots.  Those would be awesome here.\\n\\nMore leaf-clattering sounds.  Two more lumps rise from the ground, not a dozen feet away.  You push Danny faster.  You're almost at the edge of the trees, up ahead smells like a pasture.  You\u2019ll be able to go faster on the flat, grassy ground.\\n\\nDanny makes it another hundred yards, and then his legs give out.\\n\\n\"Come on come on come on!\"\\n\\n\"I can't.  I - Matthias's glamour helps, but it hurt too much.  My body's breaking down.\"\\n\\nYou bite your lip.

Their beady black eyes fix on you and they break into a run.  They're a lot faster than you'd thought but you think you have a shot at outrunning them now that you aren't dealing with Danny's weight.  You rush up the hill.  One stays close on your heels, the other cuts to your left.  You angle right to avoid it.  UP ahead you see the edge of the trees and there, silhouetted in the dawn light, the standing stones.  There's another just ahead, just beyond the treeline, resting in a hollow below the crown of the hill.\\nMan, those things are fast.  You try to think positively, after all, they haven\u2019t caught you yet.\\n\\nCome to think about it, that's a little strange.  It's almost like they\u2019re herding you somewhere.\\n\\nYou set foot in the hollow by the standing stone and the grassy ground that looked so solid turns to fog.  You shriek as you plunge down, down a dark shaft cut into the earth itself.  You crash headfirst into the deep standing water at the bottom of it.  The shock of cold stiffens every muscle, and you have to fight to get back to the surface.\\n\\nYou look up, up, up to the tiny circle of light at the top.  As you watch, a translucent screen of illusory grass grows back over the top.\\n\\nThe Oubliette.  You\u2019ve found it.\\n\\nYou tread water, trying to regain your breath so you can scream for help.

That whole arm is hanging limp, so he should be the easiest on to defeat.  You jump on his back, trying to claw his eyes out.\\n\\nHis body is corded with weird rings of muscle.  He whips around like a snake and pins you to a nearby tree.

What a sharp point!\\nYou shove it into the creature's chest, through the heart, grateful for all the practice you've been getting in fighting weird things.\\n\\nIt falls backwards, skin splitting as it falls apart midair into squarish chunks of wood, like a rotting tree.

No sign of her companion ... but you're sure he's fine.

I'll do it.\"  Otherwise he'll just force Danny to be the bait.  You hate watching him abuse that hold he has over one of your best friends, and you definitely don't think said best friend is in any shape to defend himself when shit goes south.\\n\\n\"Wow-ee, I am so wasted,\" you call out as you stagger toward the shepherd's hut.  \"Look, free beer!  Whoo!\"  All that practice in college is giving you some material.  Maybe you can pull this off.  You flop into the folding chair, take a swig from one of the bottles, choke, and spit out a cigarette.  \"Oh man.\"  Back in character!  \"I'm jus' gonna take a little nap,\" you slur out.  You let your eyes drift closed.  The last thing you see is Danny peeking out from the boulders, shaking his head.\\n\\nEveryone's a critic.  It's not like you took acting classes.\\n\\nAnyway, your half assed best is good enough for this job.  YOU hear an odd tearing sound and peek through your lashes and yes, that is the hooded monster.  It approaches as cautiously as a feral cat that wants the treat being held out, but more than half expects to get kicked for its trouble.\\n\\nYou hold still as it snuffles at your skin, then you clench your jaw as it eases cold, gritty fingers around your ankles.\\n\\nIt begins to drag you down the hillside, slowly at first, then growing bolder as you stay limp.

Hopefully it isn't looking.\\nIt pauses and you peek again, see the standing stone, check.  It grabs your ankle with one hand, grabs a handful of your shirt with the other.\\n\\nWait, where is Matthias?  That bastard!\\n\\nWind over your skin.  You're airborne, and then plunging down the oubliette, skinning your knees on the walls as you tumble into the dark.  Down, and then instead of crunching to the earth you plunge into a deep pit of ice-cold, inky-black water at the bottom.\\n\\nYou fight your way to the surface and struggle to breathe.  High above you see the little circle of the top of the oubliette.  Is that a head looking down?  Is it Danny or Matthias?  You blink the water from your stinging eyes.

It's just as you thought - this is aaaaaaaalllll about him, not one mention of keeping Danny alive or fighting beside you as an ally.  Sounds like he sees you as a rabbit's foot or something, and just as disposable.  \\n\\nThese vampires are going to learn they\u2019ve fucked with the wrong human.

Black cloth draping the walls, leather-topped furniture, a whole line of crops, whips, and other spanky-panky items on the walls, masks, threatening boxes off to the side ...  okay, cardboard boxes.  But you're sure there's something disturbing and battery-powered inside them.\\n\\nMatthias opens a dresser in the back, rifles past some black lacy things, some wet-shiny vinyl outfits, and pulls out ... a french maid uniform.  The costume, not the genuine article.\\n\\n\"Aw, not that one!\"\\n\\nHe narrows his eyes and pulls out a crotchless latex catsuit with strategically placed holes over the nipples.  He holds it up for you to see.\\n\\n\"Fine.  Give me the maid's outfit.

You'd been a little worried about one of the guys getting an eyeful, but they\u2019re totally absorbed in poring over some mystical tomes. Matthias pulls out one book after another, muttering explanations and pointing at arcane symbols and illustrations.  Danny has pulled out a little notebook and is scribbling away.\\n\\nNerds.  \\n\\nAfter a moment of debate, you decide to add the thigh high stockings.

There's no telling what kind of stains the maid outfit's underwear has.  \\n\\n[[C12]]\\nAre there a couple things you need to clarify about Matthias's so-called 'plan'?\\n\\n[[C13]]\\nThat's a weak plan for a bad situation. You'd feel a lot more confident about surviving the night if you were armed with, say, a vampire-slaying dagger...\\n\\n[[C14]]\\nDanny is in the worst shape of the three of you.

A thin line of blood appears on his cheek, and blue flames hiss like flashfire across his body.  In the space of two fast heartbeats, the vamp has burned to dust.\\n\\nAnother vampire stands there.  He is medium height and slim, with long black hair that curles at his shoulders and deep grey-green eyes.  There is a scar across his nose; whatever made that mark broke cartilage and now his nose is crooked.  There is another scar on his neck, just below his jaw ... as if someone had tried to cut his throat.  He's smartly dressed in a kneelength tweed coat and a suit, both of them caked in bloodsoaked ash.\\n\\nHe's holding a wide bladed Roman dagger.

And I have retrieved a weapon that can dispatch you.\"  He halfp-turns, keeping an eye on Ralon, and shouts over his shoulder, \"Daniel, bring up the car.

He looks awful, like he'd run two allnighters on not enough caffeine.  He ducks through it and disappears before you can say anything.\\n\\nRalon growls, the bass rumble dragging your attention back to the fight.  He's grinning savagely.  He looks like a pretty rough sort, the kind Misha might flirt with.  He's slicked with blood from his blond hair to his sleeveless shirt to his mudcaked combat boots.

You wouldn't risk harming a young woman, would you?\"  He turns and breathes in your hair.  \"Nice little thing like this...\"\\n\\nMatthias tightened his lips and lashes out, right for your stomach.  Ralon dropped you as he fled back a few meters.\\n\\n\"Haha, I guess I was wrong.\"  He winks at you.\\n\\nYou decide it's time to get out of here.  You stagger to yoru feet.\\n\\nRalon spits something black at Matthias which he is not able to dodge.  \\n\\nMatthias falters, dropping to one knee.  Ralon is suddenly on his back, on top of him, biting savagely at the side of his neck.  You see even omre black start to spread through Matthias's veins, pulsing down.  Matthias stabs backwards, randomly, catching Ralon in the ribs.  Ralon howls and twists away.  The dagger cracks and you see the tip of it sticking out of Ralon's chest.  Blood gushes down, pattering on the ground.\\n\\nRalon wheezes with laughter.  He claps, slowly.  Every remaining vamp in the area looks up, staring at him, shaking with tension like hunting dogs hearing  their master's whistle.\\n\\n\"Kill him, my spawn!\"  Ralon turns and runs away in a blur of speed.\\n\\nThe two larval vampires nearest take advantage of Matthias's weakness and pile onto him.\\n\\nNearby you see a few planks of the fence have been broken.

The guitarists clutch their instruments and run for the exit.  The drummer takes a running leap at the fence behind the stage, snags the top, and two vamps grab his leg and drag him down to his death.  The singer picks up his mic stand, pointing it at Ralon like a spear.  \\n\\nRalon laughs, snatches up the stand in a blurred-fast motion, and rams the pole through the singer's heart.  Blood fountains across the stage.  You step back on instinct alone; it's not like your boots could get any bloodier or filthier.\\n\\nShit, you think to yourself.  Misha is going to be pissed about this, she'd jerk off every night to her lifesize poster of Deadfalls' singer.\\n\\nRalon turned around and surveyed the crowd, which was looking a lot thinner.  \"Look at this.  Five minutes, and they're mowing the humans down.  Now this is more like it,\" he crows.  \"Good strong cattle make a good, strong army.\"\\n\\nThere's a sound, like meat sizzling on a grill.  \\n\\nHe freezes and cocks his head.

HIs clammy, cold flesh suddenly gets warm.  That's not good.\\n\\nMisha pulls him off and yelps.  Flames are licking up under the collar of his leather jacket.  He thrashes again, the fire rises, and you see ash spreadind and drifting in the air, rising in the currents of the flames.\\n\\nBeyond the fire, you see the beer tent girl.  She'd run off, abandoning you two ... but she hadn't made it far.  It was too late for her, but the two of you were still alive and kicking.\\n\\n\"Let's get out of here,\" You tell Misha.\\n\\n\"I'm not gonna object.\"\\n\\n[[A14]]\\nUnfortunately, something heavy tackles you from behind. \\n",

He's carrying a silver tray with a glass pitcher of some thick, red liquid.  \"Here's refreshments, if we have a pleasant chat.  Oh good, here are my gravediggers.\" A collection of six middle aged and older men come in.  They're all wearing worn jeans and dirt-stained wifebeaters or t-shirts.  \"You lot, wait by the door.  We may need your services if this day ends like the last time we three were together.\"\\n\\n\"Sadora, you are lovelier than ever.\"  Matthias's smile doesn't reach his eyes.  He kneels at her feet and takes her hand.  She dances her fingertips over the unleashed bite on his neck.  Matthias leans in to kiss her fingers.  He freezes before his lips touch her.\\n\\n\"Oh yes, I was just squeezing some fresh, hot blood for us to enjoy.\"\\n\\nHis left eye twitches.  \"From that mortal?\" He gestures at the guy dangling above the Zen garden.\\n\\n\"And a homeless teenager my people found last night.

We're pretty thirsty after such a long ride here.\"\\n\\n\"Life threatening wounds do tend to whet the appetite.\"  She trails her finger down his rippling abdomen and circles around the bandage on his gut.  \"I suppose you'd like me to do something about that, hmm?  A little appetizer of the mother blood, before we get to the real debate - do I chain you in my kennel or on my bed?\"\\n\\n\"What?!\" he roars.\\n\\n\"I remember those first few years after I turned you.  Do you really think you've grown strong enough to resist my influence, when your body is swimming with more of my blood?\"\\n\\n\"I'll drain you into a kiddie pool and swim through that!\" Ralon roars.\\n\\n\"Vile demon, your reign of terror on the noble Scots ends today!\"\\n\\nYou shake your head.

Ralon goes low, tackling her around the waist.  \\n\\nShe blinks behind them, grabbing them by the hair and jerking backwards, neatly snapping their necks.\\n\\nThe next blink, she is seated at her throne.  \"Fools.  As soon as I knew you were here, used my magic to listen.  I heard all about your plot to get the cure and kill me.  Haven't you learned anything in your afterlife?  First you kill ... each other.  Then I grant a second chance at unlife ... to one of you.\"  She holds up a single stoppered phial of blood.  \"Let the grand game begin!\"  She slips it back into the pocket of her robe.  From your angle, you can catch a glimpse of a second phial.  \\n\\nMatthias and Ralon twitch, arms and legs spasming as their spinal cords heal.  They stand and glare at her, making no move to kill each other.\\n\\n\"I am surprised.  I thought there was nothing you two hated more than each other... Minions!  Come to me!\"\\n\\nDozens of archways shimmer into existence and creatures come boiling in ... all manner of weird, animated monsters.  Giant hell hounds, tall monsters with scythes, creatures of wood and stone, mummified monks and moving armors ... and a snake.  The biggest snake you've ever seen or heard of, so huge even cows would be in danger around it.\\n\\n\"Now kill,\" she purrs.  \\n\\nMatthias and Danny rush away from the horde, making a stand by the Zen garden which is rapidly turning into a non-peaceful place.\\n\\nRalon and Misha run for the doorway, tag teaming each other in the entrance to the hall.  They soon vanish from sight in a teeming mass of attacking monsters.\\n\\n\"Want to see a trick?\" Sadora asks you.  She gestures at the table of candles and the flames separate from the wicks, rise up into a ball which turns into a roaring line of fire.  This flame monster takes a lazy circle in the air and floats over toward Danny and Matthias.\\n\\n\"Don't-\"\\n\\n\"Grow a spine, there's more to come.\"  She stands, holds her arms out into a T, and her veins rip open.  Blood spurts out of her, her body seems to shrink, withering down like a deflating balloon.  The blood hits the ground and writhes outward like tentacles, touching minions in the battlefield.  Everyone it touches roars and attacks with berserk fury.\\n\\n\"You disapprove.\"  She grins ... or maybe her face is withering into a rictus.  \"Who would you have me spare my full wrath?\"\\n\\n[[I2]]\\n\\nMatthias.\\n\\n[[I3]]\\n\\nRalon.\\n\\n[[I4]]\\n\\nThe humans.\\n",

But the straggler vamps are, for now, giving a wide berth to the newcomer with the dagger.\\n\\nYou get a better look at the new guy as you walk closer.  Medium height, slim build you would guess, but he is wearing a heavy kneelength tweed coat and a suit, both caked in blood and spotted with ash.

He glances down at you, meets your eyes -\\n\\nRalon takes advantage.  He spits something black at Matthias, twists aside but still is stuck with it.

More black starts to spread through Matthias's veins, pulsing on its way down.\\n\\nMatthias flails and stabs Ralon between the ribs.

It's not pointing an index finger, either.\\n\\nThat looks like the kind of place Misha might go ... and you're curious about it yourself.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Deadfalls is about to start and Misha is so obsessed she keeps saving money to get a band logo tattoo.  Money she invariably blows on tequila before she's saved much up.  But enough about her bad money management, she may be in the crowd that's surging for the stage.  You'd better decide soon, the floodlights are flaring over the stage and music has started playing.\\n\\n[[A2]]\\nWant to vent some of your own Rage against the Man?\\n\\n[[A3]]\\nWant to try your luck with the crowd of Deadfalls fans?\\n",

You look up ahead and see a massive wooden table, round, about twenty feet across.  There's a ring of mismatched chairs about it.  That thing looks heavy enough to give even her trouble to flip over.  \"Under here!\"  \\n\\nEveryone crawls underneath, to the very center.  The vampires look out, eyes glinting in the light.  You help Danny take off his coat and stuff it under his head.  He lies there, moaning softly and cradling his magic=burnt arm, until Matthias reaches out absently and hits him with another glamour.  Misha curls into a ball against Danny's side, her injured shoulder glinting with blood and worse.  She's been smelling of rot for a while, and now the smell's getting stronger.\\n\\n\"Just a little longer.  Stay with me.\"\\n\\nMisha heaves for breath.  Danny reaches out and squeezes your fingers.  His voice is giddy and slurred.  \"Don't worry about us.  Get out of here alive. Thas' all I want anymore...\" He trails off and his hand goes limp.  \\n\\nYou can still find a pulse.  Misha is still kicking.  You don't have a dagger, a plan, or even one ally you trust, but you'll find a way to save them or there will be hell to pay.  \\n\\n\"So!\"  You turn to the vamps, ready to give them a piece of your mind.\\n\\n\"Sh.\"  Matthias holds his hand over your mouth and listens.  He bares his teeth in frustration.  \"She's here' and she's released a spell.\"\\n\\n\"What kind of spell?\"  You ask from morbid curiosity; so far, all the kinds have been bad.\\n\\n\"Long ago a coven of witches tried to kill her.  The blight failed, so they unleashed their most potent magic- a spell that would flood the catacombs, destabilize them, and cause them to collapse.  The spell is centered here, in the Dark Garden, writ in the walls in indelible runes.  All her mystical art could barely contain it ... and now she is relaxing her wards.\"\\n\\nA thin trickle of water slides over your palms as you kneel under the table, and you can hear water dripping faster from the stalactites.  The air is thick with the smell of murk and rotting vegetation, the scent of Lake Nathair.  \"She's flooding the cavern?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed.  She will flush us out, let the waters sweep us into the final embrace of her arms as she waits downhill.  We must act soon.\"\\n\\nYou crawl to the edge of the table, peek around a rocking chair whose woven-rope seat has rotten through, and look around.  In the wall nearby, the one sloping downward, you see a small wooden door that sits slightly ajar.  At the bottom of the hill you see Sadora.  She's stripping off her robe, and hangs it on a statue of Medusa battling Perseus.  As you watch, trails of blood run from her eyes and drip into the waters at her ankles which are starting to churn as the current flows faster and they rise.  When her blood touches the surface it goes still as a mirror.\\n\\nShe gestures in a rough circle at the walls and her mouth moves silently in another incantation.\\n\\n\"There's a door right here,\" you whisper.  \\n\\n\"Yeah,\" Ralon answers.  \"I think that will take us up and into another entrance to the wine cellar, assuming she hasn't had it bricked over.\"\\nSounds great.  \"If we hurry-\"\\n\\nWith a snap of magic like a rubber band against your skin, the spell the Maker was casting rocks through the cavern.  The door ahead melts away leaving smooth stone behind.\\n\\n\"Shit!  She's sealed us in.\"  You crawl back to the others.\\n\\n\"We must make our stand here,\" Matthias says.  \"My strength is ... at low ebb.  Yours,\" he nods at Ralon, \"is likely the same.  I have lost the dagger ... perhaps you were fortunate enough to pick it up, and just happened to forget to return it?\"\\n\\n\"What-you lost the-damn it, Matthias!  I don't have it!\"\\n\\nWell, you know for sure you don't have it.  One of them is lying, or maybe it fell out while they were running, or fighting.  \"Whatever.  Shit happens, move on.\"  \\n\\nMatthias nods.  \"We must get that phial of our Maker's blood, and somehow bleed her of even more.  This is a considerable task as she is actively casting magic and her blood is no doubt weaponized -\"\\n\\nDanny would have been fascinated.  You aren't Danny.  \"She lied to you,\" you interrupt his speech.  \"There's two phials.  We just need to grab one.\"\\n\\n\"Ah.  Well, that is a small ray of hope in this darkness.\"\\n\\nRalon nods.  \"My girl Misha and your Danny aren't any good like this, but we've got one human in fighting shape.  We've gotta split up, someone steal the blood while someone else distracts her.\"\\n\\n\"I'll steal it.\"  You're good at snitching small, valuable objects.  And you're sick of being the bait; let them try it this time.\\n\\n\"Right.\"  Ralon and Matthias start crawling out toward the center of the room.  \"Get close and wait for our signal.  Things will start exploding.\"\\nHe's probably not joking.\\n\\nYou crawl to the edge of the table and survey the scene.  You need to pick the right path to approach the statue, some place with enough cover but not so crowded you can't move quickly.  After another quick peek, you see two options that lead up to the Medusa.  There's what you will charitably call a 'modern art display' of different sized mirrors dangling from the ceiling on chains.  They might make a good cover.  On the other hand, the Medusa isn't the only statue she's got to display her clothes.  There's a miniature wardrobe down there on marble and bronze figures, mixed in with the occasional plastic dummy.  Some of the costumes on them are really bulky ... a petite girl like you could hide among them.\\n\\n[[L5]]\\n\\nInto the path of mirrors.\\n\\n[[L6]]\\n\\nYou're going to try the statues path.\\n",

There's an archway up ahead, there's light!\\n\\nYou burst out into the next room and fall on your face.  What th- the whole cavern is tilted about ten degrees, the bedrock floor angling down to the right.  It wasn't always like this, the stalactites and stalagmites are at ninety degrees to the floor up until their very tips, where the new growth shows them bending...\\n\\nEverything is wet.  The water drips continuously, the air reeks of rotting-weeds-and-ozone, that is, Loch Nathair.  The gilt chandelier hanging at an angle from the middle of the chamber and casting the dim light of a sun behind clouds is glistening with water.  \\n\\nThe room itself is set with a strange mishmash of statues, curios, and dead or dying plants in pots.  \\n\\n\"Hst!\"\\n\\nYou scramble after Ralon.  Matthias is supporting Misha and Danny as the five of you try to simultaneously tiptoe and run.  \\n\\n\"This way,\" you whisper, pointing to the uphill left corner.  There's a miniature library set up here, a miniature maze of twelve-foot wooden shelve creaking under the weight of rotting books that obviously haven't been touched in a while.  It looks at least vaguely defensible.  Everyone files in and you discover in the middle of the shelves there is an embroidered fainting couch.  All the colors have gone grey and the cushions sopping wet.  \\n\\nMatthias lays Danny on the couch; he clutches his forearm and groans.  Matthias shushes him with another glamour whammy and he goes limp, eyes glazed.  Misha crawls onto the other end of the couch and curls into a miserable ball. She's wheezing, and you can hear a bubbling sound every time she exhales.  \\n\\nYou pat their shoulders.  \"Hang in there just a little longer.\"  \\n\\nMisha shudders and a thin line of black ooze runs from her mouth.\\n\\nDanny smiles; his eyes seem to look right through you.  \\n\"It's okay.  You tried.  Just get out of here alive.\"\\n\\nNot a bad sentiment, and you do have your secret weapon - that dagger - so just maybe you can pull it off.  But you aren't willing to give up just yet.  You aren't ready to lose them.\\n\\n\"Look at them!\" You hiss the words at the vampires.  \"We have to do something now!\"\\n\\nRalon nods.  \"We're at the end of the line.  The water's rising.\"\\n\\nNow that he mentions it, you hear the water dripping faster from the ceiling.  When you look down, you see trickles of wet running across the floor that you don't think were there before.  \"What is this?\"\\n\\n\"The coven that tried to kill Sadora had a spell up to flood the catacombs, and then collapse them.  Even she couldn't survive that.  The spell started here, in the Dark Garden, and she was barely able to hold it back.  Looks like she's so angry she'll relax the wards, let the flood flush us out and sweep us to her.  She'll be waiting for us downhill.\"\\n\\nYou sneak to the edge of the bookshelves and peek down the side.  There's a two-story-tall archway in the middle of the 'uphill' wall.  You don't see anything lurking in there ...  \\n\\nNow that Ralon's mentioned it, you can see two sets of runes scattered on the roof, the walls, even the floor.  Each rune scorched into the stone has another, meticulously chiseled in, next to it.\\n\\nFarther down the hall, you see Sadora just as Ralon predicted.  She's pacing back and forth, blood running from her eyes.  She takes a minute to slip off her robe and tie it over a statue of Medusa versus Perseus.  She reaches into the water pooling over her ankles and splashes it over her face ... the water tinges red as her blood mixes with it and instead of splashing, it goes still as a sheet of glass.  She throws her head back, holds up her palms, and her mouth moves in a silent chant.  That can't be good.  A day like today can make you paranoid about everything.\\n\\nYou go back to the others and tell them what you saw.  \"We can't stay here.  I think we should make a run for the door at the top of the 'hill'.\"\\n\\nMatthias nods slowly.  \"That tunnel leads to the warrens, which should be only lightly guarded since we have killed most of the simulacra and tamed monsters.  If-\"\\nA spell rushes through the chamber like the aftermath of thunder and you see the door vanish.\\n\\nMatthias closes his eyes.  \"She has sealed us in.  It seems this is our battleground.\"\\n\\n\"Okay.\"  Ralon squeezes his shoulder.  \"I'm running pretty low on blood, you're probably even worse, but at least we have the dagger-\"\\n\\n\"I've lost it.\"\\n\\nRalon's eyes bulge.  He's speechless.\\n\\nYou keep your mouth shut and your pokerface on.\\n\"Moving along,\" Matthias continues, \"We must gain the cure from our maker, and somehow extract more of her accursed blood-\"\\n\\n\"There's two cures,\" you point out.  \"She's got them in the pocket of her robe, which she left on a statue down there.\"\\n\\n\"Then there is hope.  Misha and Daniel are beyond aiding us, but you are still reasonably healthy.  Someone needs to distract her while another party steals the cures.\"\\n\\n\"I'll be the distraction.\"  You've got the knife, so you feel up to the challenge.  But how will you pull this off?\\n\\nYou peek around the corner and see, by the far wall, a trio pretty creepy totem poles made out of carefully stacked bones.  They look like they're barely holding in balance ...\\n\\nOn the other hand, the middle of the hall is graced by an older-looking Aston Martin held in place by bricks in front of the wheels.  The Maker probably loves it a lot and would be very distracted if something were to happen to that gorgeous machine.\\n\\n[[L3]]\\n\\nAre you going after the totem poles?\\n\\n[[L4]]\\n\\nWould you like to take your rage out on the Aston Martin? \\n",

You peer around cautiously.  \\n\\nThe water down below continues to rise and is unnaturally still.  Sadora isn't in it anymore.\\n\\nYour heart leaps in your throat and you look around frantically.  You spot her, too close for comfort, pacing at the top of the room.  She has that jar which she caresses, idly tracing the runes carved into it.  She's got a mouthful of fangs dripping with poison - that's new - and her eyes are solid red, her veins a dark blue against her translucent-looking skin.  \\n\\nAs you watch, she sets the jar down next to a carved statue of a snarling lion and resumes pacing, waiting, watching.\\n\\nYou need to steal that heart.  It is literally your only bargaining chip, but if you can get your hands on it you still have a chance. But how?  She's so much faster ... you need to draw her away.\\n\\nThere's a gong at the far edge of the room.  You could throw some gravel at it and make a dash for the heart when she investigates.\\n\\nOn the other hand, you see a brazier nearby with coals smoldering in it.  It does nothing to take away the chill of the room but it does give you an idea.

You scramble to your knees and shove against the middle of the shower curtain.  IT cracks but doesn't completely break through.  You struggle to fold it into a V, and the damn wood keeps splitting and splintering but nothing resembling a stake.  Shit!\\n\\nRalon comes in and kicks one of the tussling vamps in the head.  Misha dodges his next kick, vaulting over the bed and peering over from the far side.\\n\\nThe curtain rod finally separates with a dull pop, only matched by how dull the broken edge looks.  \\n\\nRalon reaches over your shoulder and takes your makeshift weapon from your hands.  \"Bad girl.\"  He smacks you lightly on the butt with the wooden dowl, then tosses it away.  He shoves you onto the bed, leans against the far wall, and says, \"Right.  Now that we're done with the silly games, let's talk about the real game.\"\\n\\n[[D10]]\\n\\nSince you're disarmed and without any allies, you guess you can make the time to listen to him.  \\n",

He was ... \" you flash back to the lost look in his eyes.  \"He was acting weird.  He'd been hurt, somehow.  Do you think Matthias did something to him?\"\\n\\nRalon wets a towel in the sink and swipes at the blood seeping from his wound and drying on his skin.  He looks thoughtful.  \"He reeked of dying, but Matthias has never, ever tried to turn a human.  I'd guess he got cut by that dagger, and now he's dying.  That dagger hurt me like an everloving son of a bitch, but your Danny seemed pretty coherent, so I'd guess Matthias hypnotized him and took him along.  Weird, since he usually doesn't keep pets.\"\\n\\nYou don't like Ralon's habit of calling humans 'pets', but it's probably better than 'prey'.  You decide to let it go.  \"The dagger is killing him?\"\\n\\n\"It's a sacrificial dagger.  It needs to be fed.\"\\n\\n\"Jesus, so that thing is alive?\"  \\n\\nRalon glances at the well=wrapped bundle.  It isn't moving and you wonder if you'd imagined that ... pulse that seemed to run from it when you were holding it.  He shakes his head.  \"I dunno.  Never paid much attention to this mystical crap.  That's Matthias's area.\"\\n\\n\"Danny has always been into chemistry, alchemy, metaphysics...\"\\n\\n\"Heh.  Those two sound like they'll be so happy together.\"  \\n\\nHe sounds ... jealous.  You blink at him.\\n\\n\"But they won't be happy for long,\" Ralon purrs.  \"That dagger will eat his life force, eat his sanity, stop his heart.\"\\n\\n\"So nothing can cure the sacrificial magic?  What about a doctor?\"\\n\\n\"Ha.  Doctors are useless.  And I don't know of any magic that could help him ... even if Matthias broke his precious little vows and tried to turn him, it wouldn't help.  Your friend's a dead man walking.  Just like the rest of us.\"  He smirks in the mirror. \\n\\nYou're not so sure about that, but you're not going to argue with the bloodthirsty mass=murdering vampire that's kidnapped you.\\n\\n[[D4]]\\n\\nYou could ask what happened to Misha ...\\n\\n[[D5]]\\n\\nYou could get the gossip about this big hatred between Ralon and Danny ...\\n\\n[[D10]]\\n\\nYou could cut this crap and ask Ralon what his next move is.\\n",

But hey, that autographed album is going to be worth a lot more now.  If you feel like auctioning it off.\"  \\n\\nShe turns her head, eyes fixed on your pulse.  It's probably too late to push her away and back off, in fact that sounds like it would trigger some kind of hunting instinct.  You push on.  \"Listen, I need you to keep it together for me, okay?  This is just like that time you dropped some bad acid.  Just stay cool and we'll get through it.\"  Her eyes flicker to yours', and then away, roving over the other vamps in the room.  A pair, one tall and skeletal and the other a pretty goth girl, are creeping closer, staring hungrily at you.  Misha bares her teeth at them and they flinch away.\\n\\nYou wish she'd say something.  She has crazy eyes, but the way she's acting ... you wish you knew for sure if your friend was still down in there.\\n\\nIt's hard to admit, but maybe you don't know her as well as you always thought.  Shouldn't you be able to tell, just by looking, if she's okay or gone for good?\\n\\nBut you do know Misha always likes to go to concerts prepared. Meaning, smuggling a weapon or three in, just in case some headbanger comes after her.  It would be really nice if you, the soft squishy human in this little mix, had one of those weapons ...\\n\\nYou reach into the pockets of her jacket, slowly, watching her carefully.  She doesn't react as you pull out...\\n\\nA bloodstained concert ticket, and a dental dam in its little wrapper.\\nGreat, that'll save the day.\\n\\n\"Having fun?\"  Ralon's at the doorway, freshly showered and shirtless.\\nYou jump, dropping what you'd taken off Misha.  He glances down and you have the uncomfortable feeling he can read 'easy greasy dental dam' on the plastic cover.\\n\\nHe walks in, smirks at you, and leans against the wall by the door.  \"So.

Only two women survived the big fight.  \"Stacks or the goth?\"\\n\\n\"Stacks.

Aren't they vampires too?\"\\n\\n\"They're still turning.  It takes a couple days.  But the vampire blood in them isn't strong enough, and they won't make it out the other side.\"\\nYou think back to the fight you watched.  \"So they're all rotting alive.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah.\"  He turns on the shower, adjusts the water temperature, and steps under the spray in his jeans.  \\n\\nOh no.  He doesn't get to change the subject this easily.  \"And the people you turn always end up like this?\"\\n\\nHe doesn't have a problem hearing you over the water.  He cocks his head and shrugs.  \"I've tried picking the strongest, healthiest people I could find.  I've tried turning them when I'm bloated with blood.  I've talked to witches, looking for a spell or potion.  They always turn out the same.\"\\n\\n\"How-\" No, you're not going to be a cliche and ask 'how can he do this'.  You already know.  He's an arrogant, murderous vampire with no soul.  That's how.  \"Why her?\"\\n\\n\"I was hurt and hungry.  She was there.  And I could see how strong she was, how brave.\"  He steps out of the shower and leans against the doorway, towelling his hair, looking at Misha.  She's sitting on the edge of the bed, her eyes flicking between you and him.  \"Loyal,\" he continues.  For a moment his mouth turns down at the corners and his eyes are sad.  \"Strong people last longer during the transformation, and I need strong minions to defend me, and distract Matthias while I kill him.  It seemed like a good idea at the time.\"\\n\\n\"Th- really?  That's the best you can do?  All these people are going to die and you-\"\\n\\nHe grabs you by the throat and shakes you.  \"Everybody dies.  It's just a question of when.  You'd better make peace with your friend before she loses it and has to be put down, or she drops dead.\"  \\n\\nHe lets you go and turns back to the mirror, fiddling with his bandages.\\n\\n\"So nothing can help Misha?\"\\n\\n\"There's nothing I can do.\"\\n\\nHm.

He goes to the sink and starts scrubbing.  \"Why the fuck should I let him go?\"\\n\\nActually, you said 'let it go' ...\\n\\n\"Why the fuck should I let him turn his back on me like this?

What?  \"Were you in love or something?  Because the two of you seem like ... really different people.\"  On the surface.  But Matthias sure didn't have a problem carving a bloody path through that brawl.\\n\"You know what they say, opposites attract.\"  Ralon splashes water in his face and rubs at some dry blood behind his ear.  \"He seduced me, then he was perfectly happy to go travelling Europe on my fortune when his family found out and tried to have him burned alive - this was back when we were humans.  And I was glad to.  I wanted him all to myself.  And once he got what he wanted from me, from our Maker ... then he changed.  Wouldn't share blood with me.  Wouldn't hunt with me.

HE was always interested in the arcane, always relentless when he put his mind to something.  And now he's hunting me, and he use to know me, and he's always a move or two ahead.  He got to that fucking dagger first, didn't he?\"  The sink cracks.  Ralon snarls, lets go, and shuts off the water with sharp, impatient movements.  \"So yeah, I need a fucking army because Matthias is just that dangerous.  He's crossed the line and now, this is the endgame.  The end of us, and with a little luck I won't follow him into hell just yet.\"\\n\\nHis eye is twitching, and this is a very small space, and you don't have a stake.
