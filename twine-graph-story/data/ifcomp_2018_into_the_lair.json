You find the door to the catacombs with no problem, winding stairs leading deep under the earth, and review what you remember of Viscardi. He should be asleep as the sun rises, his coffin far across town under the Marquis family crypt. Nearby will be his amulet of false life, which he'll use to walk out in the sunlight and out of your grasp if you don't get him before noon. And between here and there, at least five more thralls under Viscardi's control - unless he's gotten more since you were freed.\n\nYou've been dreaming of this day for weeks, and there's one thing you need to do above all else:\n\n1. <span id=\"oneAct\">[[Kill Viscardi|Objective][$goal to \"kill\"]]</span>\n2. <span id=\"twoAct\">[[Free the thralls under Viscardi's control|Objective][$goal to \"free\"]]</span>\n3. <span id=\"threeAct\">[[Steal that amulet  of false life for yourself|Objective][$goal to \"steal\"]]</span>",

Too dangerous to live, is what you think. And if, in the meantime, you get your revenge on him for what he did to you, well, all the better.\n\nYou've packed everything you could get your hands on that you think will help you kill Viscardi, primarily a silver blade, one of the few weapons known to kill a vampire. You even made some old fashioned stakes in your downtime, and snagged a box of matches to burn this whole place down if it comes to it.\n\nViscardi's coffin is on the other side of these catacombs. If you could have broken into the Marquis' house directly that would have been better, but it's too heavily guarded by those Viscardi //hasn't// yet turned into slaves. Ideally you should attack him while he's still sleeping - you honestly don't know if you could take him in single combat. But if it comes down to it, you're certainly willing to try.\n\n<<elseif $goal is \"free\">>As the poison cleared out of your system you started to remember more about your time as Viscardi's thrall, and none of it was pleasant. Wil freed you because you were the first one she could find, but there are some thralls down here who've been under Viscardi's control for years longer than you had. They deserved to be freed.\n\nWhile you were one of them, you worked with the other thralls to carry out Viscardi's orders, cutting new tunnels of the catacombs or guarding prisoners in the dungeon... or supplying him with fresh blood from your own body. Now you don't have any blood to spare, and you're taking his stores away from him.\n\nWil gave you a silver blade, one of the few weapons that can kill a vampire, before you left. It's now strapped to your hip. She also explained how to turn a thrall into a vampire, like she did to you. It's a mix of knowledge you're not yet sure what to do with.\n\n<<elseif $goal is \"steal\">>It's never been Viscardi who was powerful: it's that amulet. You remembered it, when your memories started trickling back to you. He wore it every day, kept it protected near his coffin when he slept, relied on it. If you can take it away from him, he'll be nobody - and you'll finally be able to feel the sunlight again.\n\nYou weren't allowed in Viscardi's personal crypt much as a thrall, but you saw it once or twice. Near the coffin is the box he keeps that amulet in. While he's asleep its only guard is whichever thrall is stationed there for the day, and with this new life Wil gave you, you're much more powerful than any thrall.\n\nYou never told Wil your plan because she seemed wary of the amount of interest you had in that amulet. She certainly wouldn't approve. She let you keep the silver blade she was training you with but warned you not to let your new life turn you into the same kind of monster as Viscardi. You know that's not going to happen.\n\n<</if>>Your foot touches the bottom stair of the crypt and finally, you:\n\n1. <span id=\"oneAct\">[[Enter the catacombs|MazeStart][$wait to 0]]</span>",

I try to save as many as I can, to help.\"\n\nYou remember barely hearing that last part because you were so struck by what Wil had said before.

Stop yourself from killing her\n\nYou pull yourself back but just barely. The thrall is still alive for now, but you realize you probably took too much. She won't survive for long, At least not the way she is now.\n\nYou draw out your blade and cut a painful stripe across a hand, the way Wil showed you, to get draw your own blood. Before the woozy thrall can faint you cover her mouth with your bloody palm. The blood doesn't take long to act. As soon as it hits her system she falls unconscious, into your waiting arm, and you lower her down to the floor. You just need her breathing to even out, her heart rate to slow to a steady pulse, and... there. She won't wake up alive, but she will wake up.<<set $thrallQuarters to \"freed\">><<set $freed += 1>><<set $firstBite to \"yes\">>\n\nYou leave her unconscious body on the ground by her workstation.

Wil showed you all you needed to do to free a vampire's thrall weeks ago, and the wound it leaves you will heal in just a few minutes anyway.\n\nThe thrall reacts as your arm snakes around her head to clamp over her mouth, but she doesn't react fast enough. She pushes at your arm, at your chest, trying fruitlessly to struggle free from your grasp. You don't have to hold her for very long either; the blood hits her system within seconds, and before the minute is up she's lost consciousness.\n\nYou lower her gently to the floor while listening to her breathing and heart rate. They both slow, way down, but neither stop. She's still breathing. She'll live, in an undead sense of the word.<<set $thrallQuarters to \"freed\">><<set $freed += 1>>\n\nYou leave her body lying on the ground where it was, and stand up.

Kill her\n\nYou miss the timing by a second, so the sound of your blade scraping against the metal of its sheath is actually audible. The thrall freezes, and begins to turn to see who's behind her. Your only choice is to act fast and jam your blade into her spinal cord.\n\nYou can't actually tell if she dies instantly, but it's close enough. She crumples lifeless to the ground, almost anticlimactically, spilling her lifeblood uselessly out on the floor. It's such a waste, you think as you sheath your blade again. But at least that's one less thrall under Viscardi's command. You wonder if he can feel their lives leaving him, while he sleeps.<<set $thrallQuarters to \"dead\">><<set $dead += 1>><<set $thirst += 1>>\n\nYou're pretty sure she was the only one here, but just in case, you:\n\n1. <span id=\"oneAct\">[[Examine the room|ThrallQuarters]]</span>\n\\<</replace>><</link>> /* link replace Kill her */\n\\</span> /* threeAct in levelTwo */\n\\</span> /* levelTwo */\n\\<</replace>><</link>> /* link replace Sneak up behind her */\n\\</span> /* twoAct in levelOne */\n\\</span> /* levelOne */",

And then another. Human bones littering the ground beneath you. Some of them still have bits of flesh clinging on. You have to pull a snapped bone out of your leg, where it had lodged itself as you fell onto the pile.\n\nIt takes you about a half hour to find the mechanism that releases the false floor, and to pry it open so you can climb out. Vampire blood is dripping out of your wounded leg, and you tear off a strip of your coat to tie a bandage. You can see now a slight seam in the floor, between true stone and the well disguised mimic.

It looks almost unremarkable, forcibly set into the stone, made of wood with crossing metal bracers, and the sight of it sets your heart racing. You'd forgotten about this room. You'd made yourself forget about this room.\n\nViscardi's dungeon. The place where he takes his captives before he turns them into thralls. If you don't remember your time here it's because even now you've buried the memory too deep to find.\n\nYou calm your nerves before opening the door. It squeaks horribly - the hinges have probably never been greased - and the smell of it hits you in a wave. Human waste and rot; burned wood and skin; blood, above all else, blood. You cover your nose with a hand, and squint, because the firelight also makes this room brighter than anything else you've seen down here.\n\nThe first thing to catch your eye are the cages. There's four of them, rusty and old and not large enough for a person to stand in. There's someone huddling at the bottom of two of them. It's an odd first thing to notice, considering the second thing you notice is a man standing in the center of the room, carrying what looks like a fire poker. The tip of it glows.\n\nHe stares at you as you stand in the doorway. \"You're not someone I recognize,\" he says, in that slightly disjointed way thralls have of speaking. He looks confused, and then he raises the poker at you. \"You're not supposed to be down here. But I can fix that.\"\n\nBefore you can try to answer him, he charges. You quickly:\n\n<span id=\"levelOne\">1. <span id=\"oneAct\"><<link \"Dodge the strike\">><<replace \"#levelOne\">>1. Dodge the strike\n\nYou jump to the side to dodge the strike, just inside this dungeon doorway, but as you do so your foot hits something you didn't expect to be there. A tall brazier filled with glowing coals - one of the sources of dim light in this room - crashes down on top of you. Most of the coals hit your clothes, but more than a few fall directly onto your skin. You roar in pain.<<set $wound += 1>>\n\nThe thrall seems a bit taken aback by this as well. He missed with him jab, but instead of striking at you again immediately, he looks at you in confusion first. That does nothing to calm your anger. In a fit of pure rage you:\n\n<span id=\"levelTwo\">1. <span id=\"oneAct\"><<link \"Kill him\">><<replace \"#levelTwo\">>1. Kill him\n\nYou whip your blade out in a second and before the thrall can overcome his confusion, stab it directly into his chest. His confusion turns to shock, and your anger burns with satisfaction.<<set $thrallDungeon to \"dead\">><<set $dead += 1>><<set $prisoners to \"trusting\">>\n\nThe thrall's body falls off your blade onto a crumple in the ground, blood pooling out around him.<<set $thirst += 1>> He doesn't die immediately, but you can see the life leaving him as his blood does. You look away.\n\nAcross the room in the cages, the two prisoners stare out at you. They just watched you kill their guard, but you can't read the expressions on their gaunt faces. You:\n\n1. <span id=\"oneAct\">[[Walk over to them|DungeonPrisoners]]</span>\n\\<</replace>><</link>> /* link replace Kill him.1 */\n\\</span> /* oneAct */\n2. <span id=\"twoAct\"><<link \"Throw him into the ground\">><<replace \"#levelTwo\">>2.

He lands with a sickening crack just a few feet away from the cages, and as you stalk over to he groans, rolling over to cradle his head. He doesn't see you coming over, until you:\n\n<span id=\"levelThree\">1. <span id=\"oneAct\"><<link \"Feed on him\">><<replace \"#levelThree\">>1. Feed on him\n\nYou crouch over his body and sink your fangs into his neck, not bothering with being careful to hit the artery exactly right.

You don't care.<<set $prisoners to \"afraid\">>\n\n<<if $firstBite is \"no\">>The sensation of drinking fresh blood for the first time in your life... it's like nothing you could have imagined.

It's one of the prisoners, several feet away from you, sobbing loudly. You look up and realize that they've been watching you this whole time, staring at you in fear. You stand, and:\n\n1. <span id=\"oneAct\">[[Go over to them|DungeonPrisoners]]</span>\n\\<</replace>><</link>> /* link replace Control yourself */\n\\</span> /* twoAct */\n\\</span> /* levelFour.1 */\n\\<</replace>><</link>> /* link replace Bite him */\n\\</span> /* oneAct Bite him */\n2. <span id=\"twoAct\"><<link \"Feed him your blood\">><<replace \"#levelThree\">>2. Feed him your blood\n\nWhile he still lies there groaning, you draw blood off of your arm and force it down his mouth. He fights it, unsurprisingly, but in moments the power of it has overtaken him. His eyelids droop, and you can hear his heart rate slowing down. In moments, Viscardi's control is gone, and this man is unconscious.<<set $thrallDungeon to \"freed\">><<set $freed += 1>><<set $prisoners to \"trusting\">>\n\nThe prisoners in the cages nearby are watching you intently. You meet their eyes and they flinch back in fear, but they also glance down at the body by your feet, and seem... hopeful. You think you can understand that hope. You stand up, and:\n\n1. <span id=\"oneAct\">[[Walk over to them|DungeonPrisoners]]</span>\n\\<</replace>><</link>> /* link replace Free him */\n\\</span> /* twoAct Free him */\n\\</span> /* levelThree.1 */\n\\<</replace>><</link>> /* link replace Throw him into the ground */\n\\</span> /* twoAct */\n\\</span> /* levelTwo.1 */\n\\<</replace>><</link>> /* link replace Dodge the strike */\n\\</span> /* oneAct */\n2. <span id=\"twoAct\"><<link \"Draw your blade\">><<replace \"#levelOne\">>2.

The thrall loses his step, and the poker drives into the stone wall to your side. You step into the room, closer to him before he can react, and:\n\n<span id=\"levelTwo\">1. <span id=\"oneAct\"><<link \"Kill him\">><<replace \"#levelTwo\">>1. Kill him\n\nYou bury the blade in the thrall's chest. He takes a gasping breath, and spits blood onto your front. You can see when the light of life leaves his eyes, and he crumples to the floor at your feet.<<set $thrallDungeon to \"dead\">><<set $dead += 1>>\n\nThe poker clatters to the floor beside you, and you pull your blade free from the body. That wasn't very hard, you think. For a moment there you'd actually been worried. Must just be this place, getting to you.\n\nYou wipe the blood off your blade and resheath it at your side. Across the room, you an see the humans in their cages staring at you with wide eyes.

He's also yelling, and you don't want him to raise too much fuss, so you quickly:\n\n<span id=\"levelThree\">1. <span id=\"oneAct\"><<link \"Feed him your blood\">><<replace \"#levelThree\">>1. Feed him your blood\n\nYou draw your blade across your own skin<<if $freed > 2>> again<</if>>, and let the blood drip out of you and into the thrall's mouth. <<if $freed > 2>>You're starting to wish you'd created a bottle of your own blood before taking this mission - cutting yourself repeatedly is getting tiring, and painful.<<else>>Wil showed you how to draw your own blood to free a thrall, but you're starting to wonder if this isn't going to scar before long.<</if>> Luckily it doesn't take too much blood before the thrall's eyes close, and he stops struggling. You climb off of him as his breathing grows shallow and steady. His heart rate, you know, must also be slowing down. Viscardi's control is gone.<<set $thrallDungeon to \"freed\">><<set $freed += 1>>\n\nAcross the room, you can see the two prisoners in their cages squinting at you. They probably couldn't see what you were doing, their vision obscured by the awkward lighting and placement of torture tools in this room. You stand up from the now free thrall, and:\n\n1. <span id=\"oneAct\">[[Go over to the prisoners|DungeonPrisoners]]</span>\n\\<</replace>><</link>> /* link replace Free him */\n\\</span> /* oneAct */\n2. <span id=\"twoAct\"><<link \"Bite him\">><<replace \"#levelThree\">>2. Bite him\n\nYour teeth sink into the thrall's neck, right over the artery. The skin tears as the thrall continues to struggle for a moment, but then he goes still. Viscardi trained all his thralls not to resist a feeding. That training was done here, in fact.\n\n<<if $firstBite is \"no\">>That memory resurfacing should send you into a panic, but the surge of blood entering your body is dizzying enough to distract you.

You don't even realize where you are, until you:<<else>>That memory resurfacing should send you into a panic, but the fresh blood manages to calm you down.

They don't seem anymore frightened than when you walked in, which means they probably didn't see what you did to their guard. That's probably good. You:\n\n1. <span id=\"oneAct\">[[Go over to them|DungeonPrisoners]]</span>\n\\<</replace>><</link>> /* link replace Drain him */\n\\</span> /* oneAct */\n2. <span id=\"twoAct\"><<link \"Pull yourself back\">><<replace \"#levelFour\">>2.

What a relief.<<set $firstBite to \"yes\">><<else>>When you think he's probably had enough, you pull back. The wound still bleeds for a moment more but it begins to slow. You check to make sure he's still breathing, then prepare to save his life for real, the way Wil taught you.<</if>>\n\nIt doesn't take long to draw your own blood and feed it into his mouth. The effect takes a moment, but you can tell when he falls unconscious for real, and when his heart rate starts to slow, the vampire blood taking over. You stand up while it happens. <<if $freed > 2>>Another one freed. It feels good.<<else>>Knowing this guy is free, that he'll get another chance in at least a half of a life... it feels good.<</if>><<set $thrallDungeon to \"freed\">><<set $freed += 1>>\n\nAcross the room you can see the prisoners in their cages, clinging to the bars and squinting at you.

You:<<elseif $prisoners is \"trusting\">>You can see the two prisoners better as you approach.

You:<<elseif $prisoners is \"trusting\">>You don't have a key, but these padlocks are rusty and old anyway. As quietly as you can, you twist the metal until it's broken, and it falls apart, and the cage door swings open.\n\n\"Oh, bless you,\" the woman says. \"Bless you. Those monsters dragged us down here, had one guarding us at all times. I kept looking for an opening but I thought we'd never escape.\"\n\n\"The same guard?\" you ask before doing anything else.\n\nIt's the man who speaks this time. His voice is raw. \"No,\" he says, \"they change every day or so. We probably have a few hours before the new one comes - unless their boss shows up.\"\n\nViscardi should be sleeping now, you think to yourself, so that won't be a worry.

You even hold your hands up slightly, in a show of good faith, but they don't care. \"You're free,\" you say, and they just blink at you. Their expressions are still filled with fear, and now suspicion, and you get the idea that no matter what you do, they probably still won't trust you. Ultimately your only option is to:\n\n1. <span id=\"oneAct\">[[Leave them and search the room|Dungeon]]</span>\n<<elseif $prisoners is \"trusting\">>The second cage opens as easily as the first, and then the captive prisoners are hugging each other, tears everywhere. \"Thank you,\" the woman says, over and over.

She nods across the room at a door you hadn't noticed before. \"There wasn't a guard there when we came through, so we were planning to run that way again, if we ever could.\"\n\n\"I see,\" you say, and you tell them to:\n\n<span id=\"levelFour\">1. <span id=\"oneAct\"><<link \"Wait here while you clear the way\">><<replace \"#levelFour\">>1.

He shrinks back as you crouch over him, and you pull his hands away, exposing the skin - and a scab from a previous bite. It makes you sick to look at, but you do your best to ignore it.\n\nWhen you're done, he lies in a heap on the cage floor, eyes rolling. The woman behind you is openly sobbing, and you turn to look at her. She's still watching you. You:<<elseif $prisoners is \"trusting\">>You crouch down and the man doesn't react, until your fangs are in his neck. He tries to pull away but that just makes the wound worse, gives you more to drink, and you pin him to the floor so he doesn't spill it all.\n\n\"What are you doing!\" the woman cries out shrilly. Her cage shakes but she's trapped there, so you don't bother to watch her. There was another bite mark on this man's neck, and it bothers you to think that Viscardi was here first, but at least now no matter what happens he won't be here again.\n\n\"Stop it!\" the woman is screaming, \"stop it! Stop it!\" She's probably loud enough to echo all throughout the lair, but screams from a dungeon aren't an uncommon things.

You grab her head to block it, and then she's pinwheeling her arms, trying to drive you back. It's more annoying than anything else. You end up having to wrestle her into the bars before you can get your fangs into her, and she keeps fighting even then.\n\nYou don't stop drinking until her fighting stops. Then you let her body slump to the ground.\n\nYou stretch your back out after you exit the cages, and finally clean your face up.

His voice doesn't come from the coffin. It comes from somewhere else in the room.\n\nYou pull your blade free and spin around, holding it up to defend yourself as the vampire Viscardi himself descends from his hidden spot among the rafters. Damnit, you think.<</if>> He holds his own silver blade ready at his side, but when he lands he doesn't immediately attack you with it. Instead, he gives you an assessing look.\n\n\"I recognize you,\" he says with a frown. That voice is almost enough to send you into a panic. There was a time when anything he would say you would do, without a thought or even a mind of your own. Your first instinct right now is to run, but you can't, and you came here with a mission after all.\n\nHe's still talking. \"You used to be one of mine,\" he says, which sends a chill down your spine. You can't think of a witty retort in time. \"That's a neat trick. I thought you'd just died.\"\n\n<<if $thirst > 4>>He smells of blood. You smelt blood in this room when you entered but now that he's standing right in front of you the smell is overwhelming. You haven't eaten in years, it feels like. Days maybe? Hours?

You:\n\n<span id=\"levelOne\">1. <span id=\"oneAct\"><<link \"Bite Viscardi\">><<replace \"#levelOne\">>1.

He didn't seem to have expected that.\n\nYou manage to get within inches of his skin - the scent of blood so strong - before he gets a hand on your throat to pull you away. He holds you in a vice grip. \"What's this? Have you been starving without your master?\"\n\nYou wrench out of his grip. Your blade's nearby but your mind is still hazy with bloodlust. Maybe if you stab him you could drink from the wound, you think. You grab the sword in a loose grip, sizing up your opponent.\n\n\"If you calm down,\" Viscardi says with a cocky grin, \"I could consider giving you a pet to eat.\"\n\nYou don't bother deliberating anymore. With another lunge, you:\n\n<span id=\"levelTwo\">1. <span id=\"oneAct\"><<link \"Aim for his heart\">><<replace \"#levelTwo\">>1. Aim for his heart\n\nViscardi knocks the blade out of your grip without a thought. It goes skittering across the floor halfway across the room, and Viscardi's own blade presses against your rib cage. Your breathing, you realize, is ragged.\n\n\"It's impressive you managed to get all the way down here,\" he says, \"especially considering the daylight outside. I don't know what your plan was, but it obviously wasn't good enough.\"\n\nHe's too far out of your reach to be able to attack bare-handed, or bare-fanged. If you even try to draw blood now, it better be with a killing blow; if his blood hits the air while you're still under whatever effect this is,  you'll probably just go into a frenzy. You're struggling not to go into a frenzy, and throw yourself onto Viscardi's blade, as it is.\n\n\"OK,\" you say instead. It comes out shakey.

All the wounds you sustained in this hellhole over the past few hours are throbbing. It's like Viscardi designed this entire lair just to kill you.\n\nYou duck behind the coffin so now both it and your blade separate you from your old vampire master. He sighs warily like this is a game, and stalks closer. \"I probably should have killed you before you had a chance to run away,\" he says. You shuffled around the coffin, keeping it between you. \"If this is how you planned to come back and take your revenge.\"\n\nHe stops, and with a daunting vertical leap jumps onto the coffin. The wood groans beneath his weight, and now he towers over you, his silver blade poised, grinning. Just the sight of that silver is making your new scars ache. You:\n\n<span id=\"levelTwo\">1. <span id=\"oneAct\"><<link \"Back up\">><<replace \"#levelTwo\">>1. Back up\n\nThere's nowhere else to go, nothing else to do. Why did you think this was a good idea?

You try to speak but instead you just sputter. Viscardi jumps again, and he lands in front of you. He rests the point of his silver blade against your rib cage.\n\n\"You haven't changed much,\" he says. \"Did you come back just so your old master could kill you properly?\"\n\nIn terror, you:\n\n<span id=\"levelThree\">1. <span id=\"oneAct\"><<link \"Surrender\">><<replace \"#levelThree\">>1.

Under normal circumstances that might hurt, but you'd heal. Now Viscardi's knees dig into your gut, your head is throbbing, and the cuts on your arms you'd thought already healed are threatening to reopen. You struggle, but you can feel the silder metal already digging into your rib cage. The only thing you can do is:\n\n<span id=\"levelThree\">1. <span id=\"oneAct\"><<link \"Plead for your life\">><<replace \"#levelThree\">>1. Plead for your life\n\n\"Wait,\" you cough.

Lunge forward and attack\n\nViscardi parries your strike with ease, but you didn't think this would be an easy kill. You practiced your techniques for weeks to perfect your skill, and it seems to have paid off. You match Viscardi footstep for footstep, parrying his own blows and striking your own around the central dais of the coffin room.\n\n\"You've been busy since you disappeared,\" he says as your blades clash. He pushes you back, and you twist around until your back is to the coffin. \"You're not as easy to kill as you used to be. That's good.\"\n\nYou force a smile. \"You're just as easy to kill,\" you say, and you slip away from his next blow. \"Only now I have the skills to do so.\"\n\n\"We'll see,\" he says, and surprises you with a quick strike aimed at your neck. You:\n\n<span id=\"levelTwo\">1. <span id=\"oneAct\"><<link \"Duck away\">><<replace \"#levelTwo\">>1.

You continue backing up as Viscardi follows.\n\n\"Just stand still so I can kill you and get this over with,\" he says. You almost laugh at that.\n\n\"I'm not so easy to control anymore,\" you say, and you bare your teeth at him. Gripping your sword tighter, you:\n\n<span id=\"levelThree\">1. <span id=\"oneAct\"><<link \"Duck behind his coffin\">><<replace \"#levelThree\">>1. Duck behind his coffin\n\nYou put the coffin between you two. Viscardi glares at you from across its wooden surface.\n\n\"Yes, I noticed,\" he says. \"I assume you think that because you have sharp teeth and an allergy to sunlight now you're better than me?\"\n\n\"That's not why,\" you say. You're furtively glancing around the room now, trying to find the best way to kill Viscardi. Trying to match him in armed combat doesn't seem to be working, but there are no conveniently placed wooden stakes around here.\n\nViscardi chuckles, and you're not sure if he thinks what you said was funny, or if he's noticed your frantic looks. \"You're weak,\" he says. \"You were always weak. Your teeth may be overgrown but you haven't changed.\"\n\nHe leaps, a move you were not expecting, and clears the wooden coffin in a second. In a panic you back away but your sword clatters to the ground. You also don't notice the silver blade jammed into your own ribcage until a couple seconds later. You look down in shock to see it, as Viscardi says, \"You were a fool to think you could take me.\"\n\nYou reach for the handle of his blade so you can try to...\n\n1. <span id=\"oneAct\">[[pull it out...|PlayerDeath]]</span>\n\\<</replace>><</link>> /* link replace Cautious21 */\n\\</span> /* oneAct */\n2. <span id=\"twoAct\"><<link \"Aim for his heart\">><<replace \"#levelThree\">>2.

You parries you away, of course, but he seems surprised by your surge of energy.\n\n\"I noticed,\" he says. \"I wonder who did that to you. They should have gotten my permission first.\"\n\n\"I don't belong to you,\" you say. You're pushing Viscardi back now; he's just a few feet away from the wall of this room. You wonder how long you'll be able to keep this up. \"I never belonged to you. She freed me from you, and now I'm freeing everyone else.\"\n\nViscardi lifts an eyebrow, but you can see the muscles in his neck straining as he tries to fend you off. \"'She'?\" he says. He gives a curt nod. \"I think I know who you're talking about. Well, //she// didn't give you anything.\"\n\n\"Yes she did,\" you say.\n\n\"No - if it wasn't for me, you would have been stuck in your hovel for the rest of your life. //I// gave you your powers.\"\n\n\"I didn't //ask// for these powers,\" you say. You pause in your assault, to try to assess what he's saying to you right now.\n\n\"Maybe not,\" he says, \"but isn't it so much better now?\" He actually drops his blade a bit, drops his guard for the slightest moment, as he's honestly trying to get you to side with him? So of course, you:\n\n1. <span id=\"oneAct\">[[Stab him|ViscardiDeath]]</span>\n\\<</replace>><</link>> /* link replace Reckless21 */\n\\</span> /* twoAct */\n\\</span> /* levelThree */\n\\<</replace>><</link>> /* link replace Cautious1 */\n\\</span> /* oneAct */\n2. <span id=\"twoAct\"><<link \"Knock the blade away\">><<replace \"#levelTwo\">>2. Knock the blade away\n\nYou twist your blade up sharply and knock his off aim. It glances harmlessly off your blade. Viscardi huffs in annoyance and takes a step back, and another, as you push him forward.\n\n\"That's not the only reason I'm hard to kill now,\" you say with a grin, flashing your teeth.\n\nHe has the guts to roll his eyes at you. \"Yes,\" he says, \"I noticed. I'm not an idiot.\"\n\nYou glare and continue to press your attack, but suddenly it feels like he's just letting you. Like he's toying with you. In anger, you:\n\n<span id=\"levelThree\">1. <span id=\"oneAct\"><<link \"Back away\">><<replace \"#levelThree\">>1. Back away\n\nYou take a couple steps back, careful not to show Viscardi your back, keeping your blade raised and pointed at him. He watches you go without pursuing, until you're both standing several feet away. You didn't notice your breath had grown so labored; you take a moment to slow it down.\n\n\"You don't want this,\" Viscardi says as he watches you.\n\n\"I really do,\" you say.\n\nHe shakes his head. \"You wouldn't have your abilities now if it wasn't for me.\"\n\n\"I didn't //ask// for these powers,\" you say. Your breath is under control again, so you take a step forward. Viscardi doesn't move.\n\n\"Maybe not,\" he says, \"but isn't it so much better now?\" He actually drops his blade a bit, drops his guard for the slightest moment, as he's honestly trying to get you to side with him?

You don't even notice the twitch of a smile before you thrust, as Viscardi neatly sidesteps out of the way.\n\nYou also don't notice the silver blade jammed into your own ribcage until a couple seconds later. You look down in shock to see it, as Viscardi says, \"But you do seem to be.

Primarily, there's now a woman there, staring back at you.<<set $thrallQuartersLocation to \"alert\">>\n\nShe's carrying a rusted knife in her hands, the kind a peasant uses to prepare meals with, and she's watching you with that faraway look of a thrall. Even with the blade she doesn't look like much of a threat. Yours are longer, and your much faster with them, for one.\n\nYou start to reach for the dagger at your side, as a threat, and immediately the woman begins to charge at you. For a regular human in the condition she's in, it's a surprisingly agile move. For a vampire like yourself, it's clumsy and slow. You watch her begin to move, and you:\n\n<span id=\"levelOne\">1. <span id=\"oneAct\"><<link \"Sidestep her\">><<replace \"#levelOne\">>1. Sidestep her\n\nYou watch the thrall rush at you, and a moment before she lashes out with her dull knife, you step to the side. The knife connects only with air.

You:\n\n<span id=\"levelTwo\">1. <span id=\"oneAct\"><<link \"Stab her\">><<replace \"#levelTwo\">>1. Stab her\n\nYour hand still rests on the hilt of the dagger at your side. While her back is turned to you, you pull the dagger out - and plunge it in. You feel the blade connect with the bones of her spine.\n\nThe thrall grunts in pain, but it's muted as her face hits the floor, the rusted knife in her own hands forgotten. You pull your dagger out, and take better aim before you bury it in the thrall's body again. She's dead in moments.<<set $thrallQuarters to \"dead\">><<set $dead += 1>>.\n\nYou take a minute to clean the blood off your hand and blade before sheathing it again at your side. The rest of the thrall's blood continues to spill out of her, and you shake off the feeling of what a shame, what a waste all that blood spilled out onto the dirty floor is.\n\nOnce you've composed yourself, you:\n\n1. <span id=\"oneAct\">[[Go through the door|ThrallQuarters][$direction to \"in\"]]</span>\n2. <span id=\"twoAct\">[[Go back down the side tunnel|QuartersDeadend2][$direction to \"in\"]]</span>\n3. <span id=\"threeAct\">[[Go back down the main tunnel|QuartersTunnel][$direction to \"out\"]]</span>\n\\<</replace>><</link>> /* link replace Kill her */\n\\</span> /* oneAct in levelTwo, Kill her */\n2. <span id=\"twoAct\"><<link \"Pin her arms back\">><<replace \"#levelTwo\">>2. Pin her arms back\n\nYou grab her arms and twist them behind her back, probably rougher than you meant to. The woman calls out in pain, and she drops the knife. You gather her wrists up in one hand so you can use the other to stifle her shouts.\n\nShe's not as weak as the first thrall you faced, however. You can feel her muscles straining, and if you don't act fast she's likely to break free. You give yourself but a moment to decide, and then you:\n\n<span id=\"levelThree\">1. <span id=\"oneAct\"><<link \"Give her your blood\">><<replace \"#levelThree\">>1. Give her your blood\n\nYou knock her in the head to stun her, then reach quickly for your dagger again, to draw your own blood the way Wil showed you. It takes the woman a second to recover, but by that time you're already ready. You force the blood into her mouth. When she won't immediately swallow, you pinch her nose and wait. She fights against you, scratching at your arms in an attempt to push you away, but she's no match for your strength, and after a few moments her motions still, and she goes limp.<<set $thrallQuarters to \"freed\">><<set $freed += 1>>\n\nYou lay the woman gently on the floor. Her breathing grows shallow and steady, but she's alive, for real again. In a sense.\n\nYou try not to dwell on that thought. With the once-thrall taken care of, you can now:\n\n1. <span id=\"oneAct\">[[Go through the door|ThrallQuarters][$direction to \"in\"]]</span>\n2. <span id=\"twoAct\">[[Go back down the side tunnel|QuartersDeadend2][$direction to \"in\"]]</span>\n3. <span id=\"threeAct\">[[Go back down the main tunnel|QuartersTunnel][$direction to \"out\"]]</span>\n\\<</replace>><</link>> /* link replace Feed her your blood */\n\\</span> /* oneAct, Feed her your blood */\n2. <span id=\"twoAct\"><<link \"Drink her blood\">><<replace \"#levelThree\">>2.

It's certainly strong enough to pass through solid wood. There'd be no reason to even look at his face.\n\nYou don't bother spending time deliberating.

There's no way Viscardi should survive that.<<set $win to \"yes\">><<set $winKill to \"yes\">><<set $viscardi to \"dead\">>\n\nWhen you pull your blade back up, the lid of the coffin lifts a bit too, and you glance a glimpse of the man inside.

Viscardi is dead. He won't be able to control anyone ever again. <<if $dead < 4>>You wonder what will happen to his thralls now.<</if>>\n\nWith a deep sigh of relief you step down off the platform, and:\n\n1. <span id=\"oneAct\">[[Check the jewelry box|ViscardiAmulet]]</span>\n2. <span id=\"twoAct\">[[Leave the room|ViscardiCrypt][$direction to \"out\"]]</span>\n<</replace>><</link>></span>\n2. <span id=\"twoAct\">[[Check the jewelry box|ViscardiAmulet]]</span>\n3. <span id=\"threeAct\">[[Leave the room|ViscardiCrypt][$direction to \"out\"]]</span>\n</span> /* levelOne */\n<<else>>\n1. <span id=\"oneAct\">[[Stab the coffin|ViscardiFight][$viscardi to \"coffin\"]]</span>\n2. <span id=\"twoAct\">[[Check the jewelry box|ViscardiFight][$viscardi to \"other\"]]</span>\n3. <span id=\"threeAct\">[[Leave the room|ViscardiFight][$viscardi to \"other\"]]</span><</if>><</if>>",
