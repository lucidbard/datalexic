Help me to teleport dear listeners here and there, paint vivid pictures of the worlds, and bring individuals to life.\n\nTo understand the life of Zephyra, my Parthenos and protector, I have to take you back many years. We need to return to Kyzikos, the heavily-wooded little moon that orbits Arctonnesus, the giant cloud-covered planet, in the Propontis system.\n\nShe struggled against forces both worldly and divine. She restored freedom and prosperity for her people.\n\nBut who were \"her people?\" The Gegenees, the citizens of Kyzikos, the crew and changing manifest of //The Lady//, the nation of her father, or the lands of her mother? I am reminded of the words of Socrates, as quoted by Plutarch: //I am not an Athenian or a Greek, but a citizen of the world.//\n\nPerhaps that is what [[Zephyra|opener quote]] actually achieved in the end... \n\n<font>\n\n(set: $herculeaneffort to 0)\n",
