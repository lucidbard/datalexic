Give us faces, outfits, etc. so when someone looks at us they would never recognize us again. Utility workers, pest control, or even the cable guy will work. Now Hilda what sounds best to you?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cHow much time do we have to get this done and back here to Midgard?\u201d I ask. \u201cBryndis can you turn off the power in the building or make a pipe burst? In the movies they have limits on that stuff so I don\u2019t want to misjudge your abilities.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWe have one week to find the necklace,\u201d Bryndis replies, \u201cThe only limit I have found is that of my imagination. I can arrange either one just tell me which one and where.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cDo you remember what I was wearing when I was brought here? Just a t-shirt, jeans, and shoes?\u201d Bryndis nods. \u201cOkay put us in dark color variations of those clothes. Is our armor still effective and will all they see is what we want them to see?\u201d Bryndis nods again. \u201cGreat! This will work out fine. Now where is this portal?\u201d\\n\\nFenrir points to the back wall and says \u201cWalk thru the wall and it will teleport us to a safe spot near his restaurant. Loki isn\u2019t very original. It is an Italian restaurant. When he is on Earth he never leaves the place. I know that he is not on this realm for the moment or he would be able to sense our arrival. I will lead the way and Bryndis will follow up last. Hilda just follow me and we will get this done.\u201d He starts walking and I follow thru what looks like a solid wall.\\n\\nEverything starts spinning around me. I hear a voice calling my name and I think I moved towards it. Next thing I see is a dim room around me. It looks like a basement with boxes and other stuff that seems to be in storage.\\n\\n\u201cAre you both ok? If so lets get moving. The sooner we get topside the sooner we can get back to Asgard and training for the next project.\u201d Fenrir states as he starts towards the door.\\n\\n\u201cWe need the nearest library or cyber cafe to look up the building plans for the restaurant. This will give us a better idea on what to expect when we get there.\u201d I say while following Fenrir up the stairs. He leads us out of the building and conveniently there is a Cyber Coffee across the street. \u201cThat will work. Do you guys know how to use a computer?\u201d They both shake their head no. \u201cOk... Anybody have any American money for copies and such?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cPeople will just not notice us and we will get what we need.\u201d Fenrir says. \u201cThey know we are here but won\u2019t care.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cAnd if I wanted a coffee?\u201d I ask.\\n\\n\u201cAsk and they will make it but not notice that they didn\u2019t charge you for it.\u201d He replies.\\n\\n\u201cThat is epic.\u201d I laugh out loud. \u201cLets go get what we need.\u201d We cross the street and go into the shop. I grab a coffee and then a computer and easily pull up the building plans after getting the location of the restaurant from Fenrir. \u201cPrint and done. Lets go find a food place where we can look this over and plan what is next.\u201d I go to the counter and ask for the best pizza place in town. We are in Chicago after all.\\n\\nWe go outside and a taxi pulls up as if by magic. The driver pulls up to the pizza place and we go in. We take a table in the back, order a deep dish pizza, and pull out the building plans. \u201cNow here is the entrance.\u201d I point to a spot on the page. \u201cWe need something to make enough of a mess for them to have to schedule someone to come in and clean overnight. How about the sewer system backs up? Or one of the fridges/ freezer loses power? Something that can be a real enough illusion but needs a crew called in. Bryndis which one would be easiest to do and hold?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cProbably the sewer backing up. All I have to do is push sewage from the drains here, here, and here.\u201d As she points to spots on the map. \u201cBack up all the toilets and wa-la. Somewhere nobody wants to be. Lets make some flyers up and pass around the neighborhood. It will give us the night to get the place searched for the necklace and then hopefully back to Asgard. If not we know where Loki stays in the underworld while he is there. Two days here and maybe another two days there.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cOkay lets enjoy the pizza, find a place to stay for the night, and get going early tomorrow morning. I don\u2019t mean to be bossy but I have the impression that I am supposed to get it done and you are here for support and info on Loki\u2019s normal haunts. I really don\u2019t want to offend either of you because I know we will probably end up friends after this and at the very least I will need your help during the whole process.\u201d\\n\\nFenrir laughs, \u201cI think you are doing fine. And you are exactly right. We have been ordered to be support but the ideas have to come from you. I agree with everything you have done so far. None of us are thieves to get in undetected.\u201d\\n\\nWe all laughed at that and dug into the pizza.\\n\\nThe next morning we went back to the Cyber Coffee to print out some flyers and then off to the street to pass them out. I had Bryndis put a real companies info on all but the one flyer that we dropped at Loki\u2019s restaurant. His looked exactly the same except if they called the number on it they would actually be dialing the prepaid phone number that we had just activated.\\n\\n\u201cAll right Bryndis set the illusion of sewage to go off at the end of the lunch rush with it steadily getting worse thru dinner rush. We should get a call around that time.\u201d I say nervously. \u201cI hope I can keep it together until then.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cSpell is set. Lets find a place to hang out until they call.\u201d Bryndis replies.\\n\\nIt is about 2 hours later and the phone rings. \u201cH&B Sewage Issues. We clean up stuff you don\u2019t want to mention. This is Helen. How can I help you?\u201d I breathe into the phone.\\n\\n\u201cUm, yeah I need immediate help at Loki\u2019s Italian Place on 35th St and 9th. Everything is backing up. I can\u2019t hide it from the customers and the smell won\u2019t get out of my nose. It\u2019s freaking gross. How fast can you get here?\u201d From a deep male voice with a hint of panic in it.\\n\\n\u201cWe can be there in 30 minutes. I have a crew just a little ways from you finishing up a job. Who do I have them ask for?\u201d I reply to the voice.\\n\\n\u201cThat sounds great. Have your people ask for Tony. They will get me.\u201d Tony says.\\n\\n\u201cWe will be there. We guarantee a better day after we are gone.\u201d I say as I hang up the phone.\\n\\n\u201cThat was faster than I expected. I guess someone has a sensitive nose.\u201d I laughed. \u201cLets get moving. We have 30 minutes. The van we are \u201cborrowing\u201d is out back. Bryndis don\u2019t forget to set the illusions on us and the van\u201d\\n\\nWe drive to the restaurant and there is a definite aroma coming from the place. Open the door and the stench about knocked me on my feet. There is a girl at the front door with a cloth over her nose.\\n\\nFenrir asks her, \u201cIs Tony here? He called us about an issue.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cYes... Come right this way.\u201d She leads us down a long hall to an office and opens the door for us. \u201cTony they are here. Can I go home? I\u2019m gonna lock the front door because nobody is gonna come in to eat with this smell.\u201d\\n\\nTony waves her away saying, \u201c You are right. Have everybody else go home also. Have an evening off on me.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cThank you Tony,\u201d she says with relief. She closes the door as she leaves the room.\\n\\n\u201cYou guys are early. Thanks for getting here. Let me show you the mess and you can give me a time frame as to how long it will take for cleanup.\u201d Tony says as he leaves the office.\\n\\nHe takes you back to the kitchen and there is a thin layer of sewage on the floor. He points out the drain on the floor. He then leads everybody to both bathrooms and shows you the drains in them also with a layer of sewage.\\n\\n\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d He asks Fenrir.\\n\\n\u201cWell we should be able to have this cleaned up in a few hours. I need to figure out the issue and then my assistants can help me clean up afterwards. It will cost only $400 because we are trying to build our business. All we ask for you to get the discount is to mention us to your friends and family.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cSounds good. What do you need from me?\u201d Tony replies.\\n\\n\u201cWell just leave us alone for a bit. If you like you can lock us in here and I will call you when we are done. \u201c Fenrir says.\\n\\n\u201cThat sounds good to me. I am done with the stench.\u201d He says with relief. \u201cHere is my number. Call me however late it is and I will let you out.\u201d He hands Fenrir his card as he walks out the front.\\n\\n\u201cThank goddess, can we drop these illusions? They make my eyes itch.\u201d I ask.\\n\\n\u201cNope, there is at least 4 cameras recording video.\u201d Fenrir states. \u201cWe need to start looking for the necklace and then I can teleport us out of here.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cLets all take a room. Check for hidden doors, a safe, anything.\u201d I reply. \u201cBryndis can you get the stench gone and hide what we are actually doing?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cSure. Stench/sewage spell is gone. And the cameras will only show us cleaning it up. I will take the kitchen. Fenrir where do you want to check first?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cI will check the office.\u201d He replies.\\n\\n\u201cThen I will do the dining room.\u201d I state as I walk that direction. I start looking under tables and knocking on the walls. After 30 minutes I step back and yell out, \u201cHey guys, check this out. You will never believe this.\u201d\\n\\nThe both come running and look at the wall I am pointing at. We all break out laughing. The necklace is in the center of the wall artfully displayed in a shadow box.\\n\\n\u201cWell can\u2019t say anything about his originality. Lets grab it and go. They can have the cleanup on us since we are the ones that did it.\u201d I say as I move to get it down. \u201cFenrir where do I carry this thing?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cJust take it right thru that wall its hanging on. We will be right behind you.\u201d He replies.\\n\\nI move to the wall and thru it coming out in the Great Hall where Odin and Freya are still chatting.\\n\\n\u201cHere is your necklace back. You will never believe where he had it. Can I go to bed? My energy just disappeared.\u201d I say as I put the shadow box with necklace on the dias.\\n\\nOdin replies with a smile, \u201c Thank you for your efforts. Be my guest and go lay down for a bit. We will get the story from the two others.\u201d\\n\\nThe End\\n\\nGo back to the [[Start]] to play another story",

We still aren\u2019t allowed to tell you what you are doing here but I hope this helps to get you to believe in us.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cI don\u2019t know but what do I need to do to get more information?\u201d You say in a quiet voice.\\n\\n\u201cLets get you dressed and then we can go.\u201d Bryndis goes over to the armoire and pulls out the armor you had seen earlier. She holds it up for you and you notice the armor splits in the back leaving your back bare from neck to waist. Kinda weird way to design armor but you put it out of your mind, and you walk right into the arms. Goddess armor is heavy. Bryndis does all the straps and buckles up on the armor and then heads to the door indicating that you and Fenrir follow her. She leads you through a bunch of passageways and stops you at a huge beautiful door. You noticed that Fenrir disappeared somewhere on the way.\\n\\n[[Continue]]",

I work out my neck and shoulders before there is a knock on the door.\\n\\nBryndis walks in, \u201cGood you're awake. First thing is food, then to the pools to wash off, and last off to training with Fenrir. I know you will enjoy working with him. He will teach you stuff about how to fight with a sword that you never knew was possible. Oh, and I\u2019m sorry about not telling you what to expect but those are the rules.\u201d\\n\\nI look at the tray she brought in and there is a healthy serving of meat and potatoes with another goblet of the Mead. I couldn\u2019t stop myself from wanting another taste of that divine liquid. I sit down and grab the goblet. I take a sip and it has the same wondrous flavor. I put it down to grab some of the other food and I feel strength building up in my limbs.\\n\\n\u201cAre you done?\u201d She asks after the last crumb is gone from the plate.\\n\u201cYa, lets get to the next thing. I need to get out of this room and see some sky. I hate being cooped-up indoors for too long. I think I could run a marathon with how good I feel.\u201d As I jump up and move towards the door.\\n\\n\u201cWell you do need to wait for me before anything. You would get lost pretty easily on your own.\u201d She chuckles while walking past you to take the lead.\\n\\nI follow her through the passageways and you come out looking at a huge courtyard with people going to and fro. She leads me to a long shallow building that has steam coming out of where the roof should be. You both go thru the doors and there is a giant pool in the middle of the room. There is another Valkyrie across the way that strips off her dress and jumps in.\\n\\nI give Bryndis a look and she says, \u201cYou can walk in with your dress on and then do whatever you need to. Its what I do.\u201d And she proceeds to do just that, tossing the sodden dress to the side. \u201cHere is the soap and don\u2019t worry about getting the water dirty. The pool will re-circulate in clean water. Enjoy!\u201d\\n\\nAfter repeating what Bryndis just did I go straight for the soap and lather up. After completing 3 cycles of rinse-lather-repeat I finally feel clean again. I look over at Bryndis and she is watching for me to be finished. I move over to her and she asks, \u201dAre you ready to start your training? I know that you have had some in swordswork but have you had any other training like hand-to-hand combat or archery?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cI am told I\u2019m a natural with a sword and haven\u2019t had the time/money/teacher for anything else. I want to learn about all of the combat arts.\u201d I start bouncing in excitement at just the thought of learning about these things.\\n\\nBryndis laughs at me saying, \u201cOk lets get moving then. Fenrir will enjoy knocking you on your backside. Here is a clean set of clothes and your armor.\u201d  She points to the benches lining the side of the pool. \u201cAnd here is a towel to get you to the dressing rooms on the side.\u201d Handing me a towel as big as a small blanket. \u201cGo get dressed and let me know when you need the help with your armor.\u201d\\n\\nI take the towel and scurry over to my stuff and then to the dressing rooms. Get everything on except the straps of the armor as you step out of the room, \u201cBryndis would you do these up for me? I can\u2019t get to them.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cI will show you the trick next time.\u201d As she gets them done for you.\\n\\nShe leads you out of the bathhouse toward the sound of metal hitting metal and groans of pain. I can see Fenrir giving a sword lesson to another Valkyrie where he is showing them their openings by hitting them.\\n\\n\u201cYou know you should never fight while angry. That is how I beat you. Now go away and think about what happened here today. I know you are better than this.\u201d He turns and walks towards us. As he is doing so his head changes to that of a normal human male.\\n\\nHe gets up to the fence and asks, \u201cWill this be better for you? I have read the stories and seen the movies of what you call werewolves. I can understand the fear you may have for me in that state.\u201d\\n\\nI shake my head and quietly say, \u201cYes, I think it will help. Bryndis was telling me that you are going to be teaching me the art of combat. I have little to no knowledge about hand-to-hand but in the many areas of the country I have lived my teachers in the SCA have said I am a natural with the sword. I was about to be knighted in the last place I was at but then I was moved to another home again.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cThats good. Then you have some basics. Lets get started.\u201d Fenrir says after he hands you a practice sword. He then proceeds to give you the worst thrashing in your life. While youlat on the ground recovering from the upteenth time of being dropped he comments, \u201cYou might survive. Be prepared, because you will be sent on a quest tonight and can\u2019t come back until you retrieve what was lost.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cOkay... What should I expect?\u201d I ask Fenrir & Bryndis. \u201cWill I have someone helping me or am I stuck all on my own?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cEach quest is different for each person. All I know is that Freya is in charge of this one.\u201d Fenrir says with a worried look on his face. \u201cI have prepared you as much as I can in the time that I have.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cBut, but, but....\u201d and my voice trails off. I move away to think. \u201cWell I guess I will see what happens. Can I go back to my room till dinner?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cRest and drink some Mead. It will rejuvenate your body and mind for the challenge ahead.\u201d Fenrir state as he waves you both off. Bryndis leads me to my room.\\n\\n[[Ask to have a few minutes to yourself.]]\\n[[Ask Bryndis to come in and answer questions.]]",

His horses are running at extreme\\nspeeds. Suddenly, you see something shiny fly through one of the windows. You stop to\\nsee what it is. It\u2019s the necklace, Loki must have dropped it without noticing because he was\\nstill speeding off. You get back on the horse and turn around. You find your way back to\\nAsgard and tell King Odin and Freya that you have succeeded. They are very happy you\\nhave found the necklace and throw a feast in your favor.

Finally you realize there are people staring at you and that you have made it into the middle of the room. At the far end of the room you notice two thrones on a raised stone dias. The thrones are carved out of grey-white marble and are large enough to sit 5 large guys.\\n\\nOn one of the thrones there is giant of a man. Twelve feet tall in beautiful armor and a awesome helmet that threw off sparks of living flame. Reminded me if those guys that are in the bodybuilding contests. Then I remember that I\u2019m not supposed to look him in the eyes and drop my head.\\n\\nA great rumble of laughter echoes around the hall loud enough that specks of dust fall from the ceiling. \u201c Come closer, child.\u201d\\n\\nI couldn\u2019t help but look up to the joy in the voice. I see Him on the throne and there is a soot black raven on his shoulder that tilts its head as if aware of everything going on. The scene reminds me of multiple ones depicted in fantasy novels. This whole situation is surreal. The only thing missing is the elves and dwarves.\\n\\n\u201cDo not be afraid, Hilda.\u201d Odin says. \u201cNow I know that you haven\u2019t been told anything yet. This is what we call the Rites of the Valkyrie. It is time to accept that this is real. Now come forth and drink of the Mead. It will prepare you for the times ahead.\u201d\\n\\nA young girl comes over carrying a wooden tray with an elaborate goblet on it. She hands it to you carefully as if it filled with liquid gold. Bryndis says as you grab it, \u201cTake it with care, its heavier than it looks.\u201d I look into the cup and see that the liquid is a golden shimmer almost irresistible to not take a drink.\\n\\nI hesitate and Odin says, \u201cDrink Hilda, Valkyrie, Warrior of Valhalla, Maiden of Odin. Begin your new life.\u201d There is a feeling of comfort in those words so you lift the goblet up and take a drink.\\n\\nI almost swooned with the first swallow. It was better than the richest European chocolate. Just a cupful of pure pleasure. I closed my eyes to better enjoy while a warmth filled me from top to bottom. My eyes open and I see that I am now filled with the same glow that I had seen in others. A sense of panic hits and then I notice that everybody around me is filled with a similar glow.\\n\\n\u201cHilda, do not be afraid. It is the nature of the Mead. It is nectar from the heavens and will change your body so that it will have the strength to survive the trials of your new life.\u201d Odin\u2019s voice allowed me to focus and start to calm down. I look around and everybody looks calm and even unconcerned allowing me to realize this is a normal thing for them. Everybody moves closer and you start to feel a burning in her back.\\n\\n\u201cJust breathe through it and it will be over in a minute.\u201d Bryndis calmly states.\\n\\nStabs of pain run up my body. I drop to my knees as a gasp of agony escapes. There is a crawling sensation running inside of your shoulders. The pain seems to go on forever and then it changed. It hit another level and I just couldn\u2019t keep the screams inside. The screams seemed to be necessary element because something burst out of my back and an strange weight settled onto my shoulders. With everything else the extra weight caused me to fall backwards. I was caught by multiple arms and held up until my legs could support me again. I look around and notice that everybody in the room is 1- female and 2- have wings spread out behind them..... Including me!\\n\\nI gasped in wonder at them. They are stunning. A red bronze color that shimmer in the light. Then I realized that they are mine and I HAVE WINGS!!! The world goes black.\\nI wake up thinking, That was an awesome dream. Then I notice these are not my bed covers. They feel like fur. Why do I hear a fire? My eyes pop open and I am still in Asgard. I try to get up and there is a weight on my shoulders. I look back and there they are... The wings are waving at me. Then the whole incident came back to me. The tears just start to roll down my cheeks. How long have I been gone? How many days has passed since I was passed out both the first and second time? Does time pass differently here? I am beginning to realize that this isn\u2019t a dream and that I need to adjust to this new life.\\n\\n[[Keep believing that everything is a dream.]]\\n[[Jump into this new life with both both feet running.]] ",
