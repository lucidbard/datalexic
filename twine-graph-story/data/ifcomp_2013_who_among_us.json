I'd decided to keep one just in case.  I was planning on using it on myself, but I guess I'll just have to do that some other way...\u201d He points the gun at the Bounty Hunter.\\nYou realize then that you'd made the wrong choice: the Lawyer was the killer all along...\\n\u201cWhy?\u201d you ask him, coughing as you slowly get to your feet.\\n\u201cWhy?\u201d He repeats.  \u201cThe \u201cwhy\u201d is because when I let that criminal get out of his sentence, he killed my family and I swore I would avenge them.\u201d  He turns gun from the Bounty Hunter to somewhere up and to the side of the three of you.  There's an icicle covered overhang, holding back a massive wall of snow.  If he shoots it, he's going to kill you all...\\n  \u201cI swore I would avenge them by bringing to justice everyone who'd ever escaped from what they deserved.\u201d he continues.  \u201cSo I tracked the nine of you down and brought you hear for your trial.  And now I'm going to finish the job and let the local police find the tape and make their own conclusions...\u201d\\nAnd with those final words he fires the gun, burying the three of you under another avalanche of ice and rock.  It's going to be many days before the police find and dig out the three of your bodies.\\n\\nEND",

So a man was running out here earlier?  The killer?  Or could it have been the Husband himself?\\n\\nNexy to examine the well. A piece of severed rope is tied to a strut on the outside of the well.  You examine it and it's heavy duty climbing robe, the kind that a professional mountaineer might use.  \\n\u201cThat was part of the survival equipment that went missing from the snowmobile's trunk,\u201d the Bounty Hunter says. \u201cFor some reason this man must have been using it to climb into the well and then someone cut the line and killed him.\u201d\\nSo the Husband was going after the money also, you think.  Which means he must have had the wrong map which he took off the Warden.  So maybe the Warden was telling the truth that the couple attacked him in the garage instead of the other way around...\\n\\n[[continue|81]]",
