It\u2019s one of the few places left with an internet connection.

You box out Alice so she can\u2019t see.\n\nPolice violently detain a man. They keep swinging. Elbows and knees. Then she shows you another clip of the same.\n\nMAYA: It\u2019s happening all over.\n\nAnother clip.\n\nJACK: There seems to be no one in charge. \n\nAnd another.\n\nJACK: Unchecked recklessness.\n\nThen in the last clip you see Kurt. He\u2019s standing as two officers pin a young man to the ground. \n\nHe\u2019s just watching. Then he steps forward.\n\nYou push the camera away.\n\nPARKER: I get it... We\u2019ll go with you.\n\nJACK: Good. It\u2019s too far to go tonight. Let\u2019s find a place to sleep and leave first thing.
