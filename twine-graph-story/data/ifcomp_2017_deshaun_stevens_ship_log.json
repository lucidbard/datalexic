You would be right.  Tiffany is too old, too rich, and too orange for you.  I don't know why you don't see she's a terrible person using you to relive her youthful days of using much richer, younger men.\n\nBut okay yes also I wanted a career in the arts and this is sort of the arts or at least arts-ajacent, not that anyone cares about my careful color and sound choices.  Singers always want their voice louder at them and everyone wants to be blue for some reason and the voice controls could take over for me if I didn't disable them.\n\nServes you right Mum ran off to explore volcanoes on Venus.  I hope this letter finds you cast off by Tiffany and miserable.\n\nDidn't mean that. Love you, Dad.  I'm sorry. You were right about maybe this not being the best career choice.
