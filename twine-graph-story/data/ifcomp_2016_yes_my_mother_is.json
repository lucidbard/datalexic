Time enough to drink a little something and do some boring but needed paperwork in peace.\n\nIn spite of that, about once a week, someone manages to come in even earlier than you. And today is one of those days. A skinny, frail, androgynous, and almost anonymous in their plain sweatshirt and trainers, person is sitting on one of the four plastic chairs making up your waiting room. Well, //sitting// may not be the best of words seeing how much they're fidgeting and blatantly oozing with stress.\n\nYou're not a morning person (OK, you're not particularly better at noon or midnight), but you're not so cold-hearted as to leave them be for another thirty minutes, so you invite them to enter. They nod, stand up as you unlock the door, and are unable to hide their surprise over how barren your office is. A couple of cheap chairs, similar to the one they were resting on, a table, a metallic cabinet, and that's all. At least you have a window, even if the view goes only as far as the concrete wall of a nearby building.\n\n\"Sorry. Not the best one could dream of. Just the best the city was ready to offer.\"\n\nYou could discuss at length how difficult it already was to simply get those few square meters. Or about your attempts to improve the setting with your own money, only to have to return it to its original state (the current one) after the administration, represented by the civil servant in charge of this building, said no. The guy personally hates you and so loves to make your life harder, his hierarchy turns a blind eye on anything concerning you, and there you are with the most uncomfortable chairs in town.\n\nBut you're not here to complain about your petty problems, so you just ask your guest to take a seat and if they want something to drink. They grab a chair and refuse with a soft \"No, thanks\". As for you, you get something hot labeled as coffee from the machine, gulp it, and sit in front of the young person, ready to start.\n\nYour first visitor of the day is clearly intimidated, currently looking at some point between their feet.\n\nHow do you proceed?\n* [[You encourage them to talk about themselves.->Joss]]\n* [[You explain who you are and what you do.->About me]]\n* [[You just wait for them to say something.->Onawa, not Psy]]",

So you don't play with your pen, you don't look at the clock, you make it look like you're perfectly fine with doing absolutely nothing for now.\n\nFinally, before your nerves break, they speak. Starting with the less unexpected question, the one you've already gotten too many times to count.\n\n\"Is it true that you're Psy's daughter?\"\n\nAnd you answer it with the weariness born from a thousand repetitions.\n\n\"Yes, I am indeed the daughter of Onawa Rootless, the one the media nicknamed Psy.\"\n\nYour mother actually goes by far more than one alias, but Onawa is one of her favorite, and one she crafted herself, as opposed to this three-letter joke originating from an especially harsh satirical article.\n\nYour correction, that you tried to speak in the gentlest possible tone, nonetheless petrified your guest, and you must reassure them before they can continue.\n\n\"Don't worry. Everyone tends to call her Psy. Even some of her friends of old do so when they're not focused. It's a short, cool-sounding, name, and the one you can see and hear everywhere.\"\n\nThey nod, still afraid, but curiosity is slightly overcoming fear.\n\n\"I... For her daughter...

      "text": "Extract from a series of conferences on ''Myths and legends in modern times''\n---\nThat's it for the theory. You now know all there is to know about how to forge a legend from any petty fact, real or invented, and to nourish it until it is big enough to sustain itself. And since I see too much theory at once has sent several of you to sleep, let's do a practical study case.\n\nThere are so many good legends that it broke my heart to have to choose just one for this extended review. I had several criteria though. It had to be recent and famous enough for information on it and its circumstances to be widely and easily available. To demonstrate the power of legends, the story it told had to be absurd, the kind no one should believe and yet which is still told again and again. It also has to be as genuine as possible, meaning not crafted especially for the purpose of becoming a legend.\n\nThat left quite a handful of possibilities. In the end, I settled for Psy's Devil Eye.\n\nAh, I see some eyes are opening up. So here we go.\n\n//The legend//\n\nPsy is the devil's child, a monster with superhuman strength whose eyes turn red when she reveals her true colors.\n\n//The facts//\n\nLook at this slide. What do you see? Sixteen pairs of perfectly normal eyes. And now, the same sixteen, except redder. They probably slept as little before the second photo shoot as some of you did before my lesson. You can notice that the red isn't as pronounced or spread depending on the person. There are genetics at work there. The final impression depends a lot on how pronounced the blood vessels are, how white the sclera is, the color of the iris... Nothing special, and you're probably wondering why I'm giving you a basic biology lesson.\n\nWell, because Psy's infamous devil's eyes are among the photos you're currently seeing, and you had no idea. Without all the decorum around, they actually look pretty normal. Perhaps a little more reddish than average, especially inside the iris, but not enough to raise attention under normal circumstances.\n\nDebunking the superhuman strength is even easier. This claim is based on only one scene, and all it shows is Psy breaking someone else's bones. Tell me, how many among you have managed to break their bones without much external help, playing soccer, skiing or whatever sport you do? The human body is both more fragile and more resistant than it looks like, it all depends on how you hit it.\n\n//The context//\n\nI cheated a little with these photos. They have been taken when Psy wore no makeup, or at least no makeup making her eyes stand out. Which was not the case with the picture you all know about. Which comes from this video.\n\nWhat do we see? A protest turning bad, for reasons we won't talk about here as I would like to avoid a war in this auditorium, filmed by a bad camera and a bad cameraman.\n\nAh, here comes the moment.\n\nZoom on Psy's face. Blurry shot of bodies, legs and the sky as the cameraman is jostled. Psy's fist hitting a security henchman, her bloody broken hand at the center of the screen as the man falls down.\n\n//Craft//\n\nLet's cut the middle part to make it a two-images movie, as someone on the Internet did soon after. Now, you have, side by side, an image of Psy's face displaying a nasty expression and one of a hand in a state it shouldn't be, egregious thus inhuman, moreover red with blood.\n\nSee where I'm going?\n\nPsy indeed has reddish eyes, well one eye at least since the other is not visible from that angle, in this shot. Nothing unusual in a tear gases context, even if hers are slightly more pronounced and quick to change color than the norm. And she clearly chose her makeup to enhance that quirk, as a sort of war paint.\n\nBut it's the //juxtaposition// with another gruesome albeit perfectly explainable image which gives those eyes their particular, disturbing, aura.\n\nFrom that single dual image, the legend started fueling itself. Other photos of Psy's red eyes were found, and associated somehow with other violent events. Soon, even pictures of her giving a dark look were enough. People started to see the red where they wanted to see it.\n\nAnd it spread. Because people wanted to hear unbelievable stories about a strange celebrity like Psy. She was already alien to them, she could easily be demonic too.\n\n//Endurance//\n\nPsy did nothing to stop the movement. Actually, she has subtly encouraged it, seeing the interest of having some of her political opponents making themselves ridiculous by branding her as some witch, and of more physical people having an unreasonable fear of her.\n\nNowadays, it's pretty obvious that she can do her devil's eye expression at will. And that she uses it, sparingly, as a weapon in her fights, thus fueling the legend even more each time people flee before her sight, at least metaphorically.\n\nAnd once a legend has had time and relevance enough to root itself, it tends to remain for even longer.\n\n(display: \"Back to appropriate\")",

Gloomy oiled things, with skulls everywhere.\"\n\nYou made your response obnoxious on purpose, and it worked. For the first time since they arrived, your shy visitor switches from whispering to speaking, fire now inhabiting their voice.\n\n\"Their popularity indeed peaked during the XVII^^th^^ century, but they take their roots in far more ancient times, and never really went dead. Formats and styles just changed while the main concept remained. And I don't mean skulls. It's about how ephemeral human life is, how short and fragile it is. And I don't think that's gloom. Quite the opposite. It reminds us we need to live fully for the short time we have on earth.\"\n\nYou acknowledge their definition.\n\n\"Don't worry, I won't criticize something I know pretty much nothing about. However, should I guess that your passion is related to the reason you're here today?\"\n\nAnother hesitation. They still don't know if they can trust you.\n\n\"I can turn... pretty obsessive about graffiti. There was one time I got sick from the paint fume, despite the mask. I was painting the walls of my room, there wasn't enough aeration, I went dizzy... I managed to get out in time, but that scared the shit out of my parents. They forbade me from touching a spray ever again.\"\n\n\"And you didn't comply.\"\n\nThat's not a question. Nor a judgment.\n\n\"I couldn't.\"\n\n\"How do you manage now?\"\n\n\"I have a part-time job to pay for my material, and I paint wherever I can.\"\n\n\"So, also where you're not supposed to.\"\n\n\"Indeed.\"\n\nYou let them sum it up for you.\n\n\"I can't paint at home anymore, and public authorized spots are rarer than unicorns. So I do like everyone else. I paint walls nobody cares about, in and out of abandoned buildings mainly. But that's still not legal, nor safe. There are the cops. There are the ones who call them. There are people with no more rights to be there than me, but stronger or more numerous.\"\n\n\"It went badly at least once, did it?\"\n\n\"Yes. I escaped with just a few scratches, because they were too drunk to run straight. But now, I freak out about returning there. I got lucky once, I'm not sure I will be twice.\"\n\nThey look at you from beyond their hood, with what you guess are eyes filled with hope.\n\n\"Your mother had similar problems once. Even if she wasn't abiding by the law, she wasn't doing anything bad, yet bad people wanted to make her suffer. I was hoping you... could give me some advice.\"\n\nThat's an extremely idealized summary of your mother's life, and you know firsthand things were and are more complicated, but you understand their comparison. The main reasons your mother was hated and hunted are the ones that make the least sense.\n\nHowever, similar problems don't imply similar solutions. What freed your mother from (some of) her problems was fame, celebrity she acquired through two not-so-fun decades of fighting for her rights.\n\nA quicker solution would probably be better.

Perhaps it would be better to use \"social category\" instead.\n''Lanktar'': I too find the current wording inappropriate, but the same goes for the aforementioned proposal. Maybe \"social phenomenon\"?\n''Garden'': That's even worse! Won't a simple ''(person)'' do the trick? It's more neutral, and still makes it clear we're not using the word in its administrative senss.\n\n''Non neutral iconography''\n\n''Elyth'': The article is illustrated only by photos of persons wearing heavy makeup, a mask and/or extravagant, brightly colored clothes. Yet, nowadays, most n/a people don't adorn themselves with such costumes. They were predominant at the movement's beginnings, sported by most of its early leaders (''Psy'', ''Rainbow'', ''John Smith''...) but with time passing on and many more people joining, such a fashion became the minority, not the norm.\n''GLspirit'': And with what are we supposed to replace them? Photos of people casually clothed? \n''Elyth'': Exactly.\n\n''Off topic article?''\n\n''Faity'': Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. It is supposed to define words. And this article, as long as it may be, does not. It does recount the whole history of the movement behind it, getting lost in many pedantic digressions on the way (for example, that long passage dedicated to the precursors), but never gives a proper definition. One can read it from the first to the last line and still have no idea what a \"n/a\" is.\n''Muffin'': +1. I think the history part should be given a dedicated article (''n/a movement history''?) and this article refocused instead on listing its many definitions with the controversies each raised up. The plan should also be moved from chronological to thematic.\n\n''Fake n/a?''\n\n''Max'': Some of the celebrities given as examples of n/a people have little if any relationship with the movement.\n''DoWhatYouWant'': I don't get your point. They're all famous enough to each have their own article, and have all defined themselves as n/a. How come they shouldn't be listed there?\n''Max'': It's obvious that, for several of them, it's just a cheap marketing tactic. They are has-beens trying to gain back some of their fame by linking themselves to anything popular lately. They are not n/a, they don't look n/a, they don't think n/a.\n''DoWhatYouWant'': Non-relevant. Wikipedia is there to expose facts, not to judge the legitimacy of anyone.\n\n''Unnecessary overcomplexity?''\n\n''Vilehard'': I just don't get why we need an article of several thousand words when a one-sentence definition would do a better job: \"person not identifying themselves with any of the given options for a given social category\". I suppose we can spare an extra line to explain the term comes from administrative forms and the refusal to answer certain questions as intended.\n''Elyth'': Things are not that simple. As of today, many different people label themselves as n/a for many different reasons. But in the public mind, it is more or less synonymous with the right to wear colorful masks in everyday life. And to understand why, one first needs to know of the story behind this word.\n\n(display: \"Back to appropriate\")",

One by one. With numerous gruesome details. He may be lying. He may be telling the truth. He may mix both.\n\nThat doesn't matter. What matters is that he is making you //really angry//.\n\n\"And your boys, where are they today?\"\n\nHe looks surprised, as if he wasn't expecting you to break his monologue at some point.\n\n\"They should have been there. But they went all chicken at the last minute. Because, somehow, they're still afraid of your mother. As if she was some demonic guardian angel always watching over her little girl.\"\n\n\"//Speak of the devil and she doth appear.//\"\n\nHe laughs at your solemn statement. Then his eyes catch yours. And he freezes.\n\nThere was that one time you had a weird conversation with Ikebana. Alright, all your conversations with Ikebana are weird. But this one you remember clearly.\n\nYou were talking about the most frightening people you knew of. You ranked her third, and Onawa second. She, for once, almost agreed with you. The order was right she said. But she then told you you forgot someone in your list, someone she herself ranked second. Someone really terrifying when angry.\n\nDemonic mothers scarcely birth angels after all.\n\nHe is not so playful now. Nor so talkative. Nor confident. Perhaps he is starting to remember who he is facing right now.\n\n\"You. Out. Now.\"\n\nHe doesn't comply, yet, but he doesn't dare to start his little dance again. His hands are tensed on the bat, and he now holds it more like a teddy bear than a weapon, as if it was some magical talisman against the monsters of the night.\n\nAnd his eyes are still locked on yours.\n\n\"That. Fucking. Witch. Gaze. You've got your mother corrupted blood, you abomination.\"\n\nHe is uneasy, and you have no intention of helping him feel better. Now it's your turn to speak slowly.\n\n\"Tell me, how does it feel? To not be in an extremely dominant position of power, to not be invulnerable anymore? To realize you're actually risking something, that you're putting yourself in danger? That your little game may have unforeseen consequences for yourself?\n\n\"I'm sure that's a feeling you're not used to. From what you told me, you always take great care in choosing the most vulnerable victims, solitary members of a community whose sufferings are more likely to be ignored, or even enjoyed, by the power of law and of the people. You play your sick game safe.\n\n\"Let me rephrase that. You're a coward. The worst sort, the sort hurting others to hide its fear. And bloody shifty cowards have no place in this room.\n\n\"You see, for most people, simply passing this door requires a courage you simply can't imagine. The journey ending in this place is long and harsh, a constant fight to overcome the many biases society put into you. Because coming to a guidance office for n/a, a category of people too often labeled with infamy, means accepting you're one of them or at least close to them, and therefore share their stigma.\n\n\"You're insulting many brave people simply by being here. And that makes me angry.\n\n\"So I will make this simple enough for your little brain to understand. You can either leave my office right now and never come back. Or I will remind you of what an isolated unarmed cornered woman can do when she's really angry.\"\n\nHis feelings are printed on his face. He is remembering. The Scarlet Flowers incident. Who would be mad enough to hit a beefy bodyguard thrice her weight so hard she would break the bones of her own hand? So hard she would also break one of the the man's rib, piercing a lung and sending him straight to the hospital with his life endangered?\n\nHe knows he is bigger. He knows he is stronger. He doesn't know if he is quicker, more precise or better trained. But he is sure that you are //madder//.\n\nHe steps back. He tries to make it looks like he is not, but to no avail. He is justly terrified.\n\n\"You're all fucking mad in this family.\"\n\nA final cry, especially pitiful. You decide to stop caring at this point, rectify your position on your chair and go back to your work.\n\nYou hear him running for his life as soon as you break eye contact.\n\nProblem solved.

Just another town named by unimaginative immigrants at first, next a legal experiment gone horribly wrong^^1^^, then a dangerous political tool, and finally an independent city state.\n\nSome would object that it is not that independent, as it survives on importing food and electricity from the country surrounding it, but when a country puts walls and barbwires around a location, when it prevents any people from going in or out and washes its hands of anything that could happen behind the concrete, it cannot seriously pretend it still considers it its own.\n\nPeople who remained inside, either by ideological conviction or by lack of choice^^2^^, quickly felt they needed a name to express that this was a new city that was being born through isolation.

Today's guest is Konohama-//sensei//, world-renowned ikebana specialist, who honors us with her presence. She will tell us all you need to know about this new fashion known as ikebana style. Ms. Konohama, hello.\n\nGuest: Hello Marie-Louise. But sadly, I can't tell you anything about this \"ikebana style\".\n\nH: Surely you jest. You are a graduate from the best schools, received many distinctions for your own creations...\n\nG: I have some knowledge of the flower arrangement art known as ikebana, yes. But I know nothing of fashion. Actually, I only accepted your nice invitation for the opportunity it gives me to make the difference clear.\n\nH: But isn't the ikebana style based on the ikebana you practice?\n\nG: They do have some common points of course. They both make use of //hanakotoba//, the Japanese flower language, and they share some other color and material symbolisms. But you shouldn't confuse a bridge with a well on the pretense they are both built of bricks. Likewise, the traditional ikebana is an ancestral minimalist art with complex and stiff rules while this fashion is far more baroque, extensive and chaotic.\n\nH: I see. So you're saying this trend is a bad counterfeit of the real ikebana?\n\nG: That's totally not what I said! I don't rank art styles, even if they are some I love better of course. If I can't approve its name, one its creator never coined by the way, as Ikebana is her //nom de plume// but she never actually named her clothing style, I still appreciate it for its aesthetic and empathic values.\n\nH: Empathic?\n\nG: Indeed. If all pieces of art are trying to convey a message, this one is particularly direct in its approach. And that's not without problems as it makes use of a language designed to be equivocal and elliptical. Thus, without context, each outfit it produces can be interpreted in many different ways, often contradictory. It's only when worn by its creator that it acquires its proper sense, the behavior of the human inside completing the message. Hence why empathy is the key to this art.\n\nH: Interesting analysis, but Ikebana's infamous associability kind of refutes it.\n\nG: Does it? To have difficulties communicating through speech does not mean one doesn't want to communicate with others at all. And to get over this contradiction, one may need to create their own way of communicating.\n\n(display: \"Back to appropriate\")",

Nothing special, as long as you don't look higher than his neck. Past this point begins the wooden mask entirely hiding his face.\n\nHe owns several different masks, but they all share the same traits, and this one is not different: refined, stylized, relying on a very limited color palette. You know he sculpts and paints them himself, but you don't know how or from what he takes his inspiration. That's not a subject he talks about, nor one he needs to talk about.\n\n\"Hello John.

I've been sent by the judge to audit some big company with shadowy accounts. Let me tell you they didn't welcome me with open arms. For them, I'm a spy they're forced to accommodate. They can't kick me out, but they can spit in my coffee.\"\n\nHe taps his mask.\n\n\"Obviously, this has attracted its fair share of nasty comments. But I honestly think they would have found another way to insult me without it.\"\n\n\"How much time?\"\n\n\"At least one month. More if I find something fishy, which is the most likely option.\"\n\nYou nod.\n\n\"Anything I can do about that?\"\n\n\"Not really. That's more or less how my job is supposed to work. If it really gets out of hand, there's a whole service dedicated to solve problems of that kind. As you can guess, it's quite common in the business.\"\n\n\"OK. Fine then.\"\n\nA heavy silence follows this last sentence.\n\nThe first time you met John, he was having a ton of problems, and sessions were long and complex.

      "text": "Scan of the original paper report and of its handwritten annotations, plus retyped copy to make reading and searching for information easier.\n---\n''Ministry of Justice''\n\n''Confidential''\n\nIntroduction: A brief summary of James Alexander's career inside the police force\n\nPushed by poverty, James Alexander applied for a policeman job soon after he was of age and passed the entrance test with mediocre but sufficient results. To quote his examiner from that time: \"Unmotivated, but able enough to do what he will be told\".\n\nEven though those words show that not much was expected of him, he still succeeded in disappointing us, quickly proving himself to be an immoral, greedy sloth, his only remarkable skills being his incredible ability at dodging work and his expertise at becoming blind and deaf for a reasonable sum.\n\nSadly, nowadays, not a single piece of evidence of his implication in any bribery case still exists, as he was lucky enough to perpetrate his crimes soon before the Raingate scandal was brought to the light. In the great panic that followed this reveal, a massive amount of files were put to the torch by overreacting officials to make sure not the smallest trace of their involvement remained. Alexander's were among them.\n\nThen came the great clean-up, with many undesirable officers moved to services with less opportunities to do anything illegal, or at least farther away from public eyes. M. Alexander was thus transferred to a very bureaucratic position, overseeing people under house arrest. It should have been a dead end for his career.\n\nIf only ''Psy'' had not been one of the criminals under his responsibility.\n\nYears after the fact, it may sound crazy to have ever put such a dangerous convict under such an unreliable surveillance. But that was another time, over two decades ago, long before the social and political upheaval in which Psy played a key role. At the time, she was just yet another activist.\n\nThey quickly became partners. She was giving him money, he was helping her cheat the surveillance system. When things turned more complex, with the access restrictions to the newborn //special area// quickly piling up, he became a key member of her network. Thanks to his situation within the police and his own net of connections among petty criminals and other unscrupulous characters, sometimes colleagues, he could, in exchange for even more money, help her and her friends cross the wall both ways.\n\nThis \"mere smuggling\", to reuse the expression of one of his then superiors questioned for this investigation, is what enabled Psy's interference with the proper resolution of the official inquiry regarding the //Unconcerned Murders// case. You may recall it as a long series of violent deaths among marginal people, with pretty much no media coverage until the rising star Psy and some of her famous friends brought it to TV in an explosive manner. After that slip of communication, the police went under the spotlights, and were soon accused of not doing their best to solve the affair quickly because the victims were not exemplary citizens.\n\nAn uncomfortable position, which turned especially bad when the affair was solved... by Psy and Alexander. Perhaps not only by themselves, but at least without any official help.\n\nIn this context, with the political tensions on both sides on the wall at their peak, we were forced to sit at the negotiating table with orders from above to do anything to save face. This ended with the skulduggeries of M. Alexander somehow made official. Formally, he was retroactively made head of a small independent unit with special permission to go through the border at will and allowed to temporarily extend this privilege to guest advisors. Thus, his and Psy's implications were now legal.\n\nThis arrangement should have been shut down as soon as the masses' attention had moved elsewhere, but politics being politics, it still exists today, and M. Alexander is still part of it. The other side even says it evolved into a proper police force, \"actually protecting and serving instead of enforcing order by silencing protest\" (their leader's words), but, please pardon me for the crude language, I call //bullshit// on this.\n\nThe favorite word of M. Alexander by the way, one he cannot help but pronounce in front of any microphone crossing his path.\n\n(display: \"Back to appropriate\")",

And once again, I don't care much about you, but I do care about the rest of the world. And, whatever you may pretend, you are a person in a position of authority. Because of your family name. Because of your long experience within this community. Because of your very job as a counselor. What you say, what you do, has an influence on those around you. Especially on those who are lost, and who come to this office for that very reason, perfect vessels for your philosophy of aggressive transgression.\"\n\n\"How bad can be this be? Teaching people they don't have to passively accept every injustice life throws at them sounds like a good thing.\"\n\n\"Within certain limits, maybe. But knowing when to stop is not something you excel at. If you don't believe it, just look at your fingers. You hit like a maniac, without caring even a bit about the consequences of your actions, both literally and figuratively.\"\n\n\"You worry too much. Joss, John, everyone, they're far happier now than they used to be, at the dark time when they were afraid.\"\n\n\"My job is to worry. You call me for that. And I hope I exaggerate. But, just in case, watch out. There are some lines you should never cross.\"\n\nYou don't answer, because you don't need to, but you're troubled nonetheless. The line between what has to be done and what should never be done is blurry, so blurry. You may understand the //concept// of this line, but you may never be sure of where it stands.\n\nPart of you is saying you should calm down before it all goes boom. Another part of you is curious. It wants to know what extent an untamed fire can reach once started. And between a safe tepidness and a ferocious blaze, your heart is leaning towards the more dangerous option.\n\nAnd that's probably something you should consider cautiously.\n\nYou sit down to think about all that. And come to the conclusion you should probably discuss the matter frankly with your regular visitors. They're of course allowed to go wild, but they should make sure it's what //they// want and not some agenda you pushed upon them, even unconsciously. You're here to help, not to indoctrinate.\n\nAs for your own life choices, you've got no intention of backing down.\n\n(set: $endings's blood to true)(css: \"font-size: 2em; font-style: italic\")[Ending 5: No limit]\n\n[[After the end->End]]",

Should only be accessed by the requester.\n\nEvaluation requested by: Social services.\nReason: Application of Ms. Mary Johnson to a public servant position (stricter procedure due to troubled familial background).\n\n[...]\n\n//Report conclusion//\n\nAs detailed in this report, Mary Johnson brilliantly succeeded at every single psychological test. She therefore has to be a perfectly sane woman gifted with above average intelligence. I have no medical objection to her getting the post she asked for.\n\n//Attached handwritten document//\n\nI write here what I cannot write in the official report, as I cannot prove it and some ill-intentioned persons could accuse me of being biased by my personal opinions and sue me for that. Troubles I do not desire, but my conscience compels me to, regardless of danger, write the truth somewhere.\n\nWhat I actually think of this crazy bitch is that she is a manipulative psychotic madwoman following her own agenda. As is her mother. And I am not speaking of the poor Ms. Johnson there.\n\nShe studied psychiatry. She knows what those evaluations consist of. She knows what she had to do and say to tick all the right boxes and avoid the bad ones.\n\nThese tests are thus meaningless in her case. They prove nothing. While, on the other hand, we have a lot of evidences she shares her biological mother's madness. Should I remind you that, despite your services' best efforts to provide her with a loving and stable family, she re-established and tightened her links with the devilish Psy through the years? Clearly, this is not the behavior of someone trying to fit properly into society.\n\nYou are about to welcome as one of your owns a devious spider, and I fear there is no legal way you can avoid that. She is too smart not to get what she wants, as is her mother. But you can still take the appropriate measures to limit her bad influence to the bare minimum.\n\nI hope you will do so.\n\n(display: \"Back to appropriate\")",

Instead of basing my decisions on a set of generic and arbitrary rules, I considered each case independently and tried each time to choose the best outcome for that person.

But should I remind you you're not really the most empathic of people? Please refresh my memories, how many decades did it take you to understand that girl was hitting on you?\"\n\n\"This is not a race you know. As long as you understand right and in time, even if you're late, it's good enough. And actually, I think I'm getting quicker and more precise through accumulated experience.\"\n\n\"That's another way of saying you're still wrong most of the time.\"\n\n\"You see the half-empty glass, I see the half-full one. As always. But in this case, I'd rather make mistakes and get better at this job than stupidly use some mechanical methodology. There are no hard rules with living beings, only trends and biases.\"\n\n\"Did you just confess to sometimes making errors? //You//?\"\n\n\"Not without difficulty, but yes, I did. It's possible this work has managed to make me a little more mature.\"\n\nSilence. You're not supposed to accept your flaws that easily. But as you just said, perhaps you are indeed growing up. Or perhaps you are in a good mood, and that makes you more open to criticism.\n\nBecause you proved, or at least you think you did, that you were able to read others with a certain degree of efficiency. Something your parents are not really good at. Especially Ikebana of course, but also, sometimes, Onawa herself. And finding something //you//, Hope-Mary Rootless-Johnson, can do that your mother cannot, is a great victory for your pride.\n\nAnother, less self-centric, reason for your good mood could be that it gives you some extra confidence on the decisions you've made. That you chose your path wisely, not only for your own good but above all for the good of others.\n\n(set: $endings's empathy to true)(css: \"font-size: 2em; font-style: italic\")[Ending 4: Confidence]\n\n[[After the end->End]]",
