What, were these assholes throwing bottles at the walls to hear them break?!  \\nSomething rolls out from under my feet and I trip and fall against a small end table shoved against the wall, knocking both of us over.  One of the table's shelves falls open and a small box flies out, skidding along the floor and disappearing somewhere underneath a badly torn up coach across the room.\\nI'm struggling back to my feet when I hear the wooden hatch to the basement behind me finally break open.

There were two sets of them, one slightly bigger than the other, and they were both heading unsteadily downhill.  Without having any better options or ideas, we'd started following them because they seemed fresh and hopefully we'd catch up to their owners who could point us in the right direction back to the parking lot.\\nIt was a decent plan in theory, but I was starting to get that horrible feeling in my gut that this wasn't a good idea after all.  Normally I try and listen to my intuition and figure out what it's trying to tell me.  Right now however, I'd been so distracted  with getting lost in the woods and all the \u201coh shit, what do we do-s?\u201d.  I'd started to get that creeping tension nervous feeling, but I'd unintentionally drowned it out with trying to remember every snow-based episode of Man Vs. Wild I'd ever seen and making a lengthy mental list of what to do if it gets dark before we're safely back to our car.\\nIt can't just be me who's feeling it.  Aria had also gone quiet  and that meant that she must have been getting the intuition pricks as well.  I'd been getting increasingly alarmed at the state of the footprint's we'd been following and, without having any tracking skills whatsoever, I could only guess at the story they'd been telling me.  \\nFirst the smaller prints had been by themselves and were very careful steps, especially on the more slippery parts of the shallow ravine we'd been following.  Then the larger prints had joined them off from the side.  Next the prints had been in a circle, facing each other.  Then they'd both taken off in wide messy strides.  The bigger prints had no trouble with the snow, judging by the deep treads they'd been wearing boots, and they'd followed the higher areas that were easier to walk on.  But the smaller prints went in a direct line of very sloppy wide strides.    They'd gone straight through the deeper drifts even though that meant that they'd had to post hole their way back out.  I know from hard learned personal experience that there are few things in the world more irritating and exhausting than post holing through knee deep or even higher ice-mush.\\nAll possible meanings of this sequence of movements had been playing across my mind and competing for space against Bear Grylls, when we'd stumbled across that pile of disturbed snow that had suddenly made my inner voice start screaming to pay attention to it.  That tiny piece of dark fabric had actually made me stop mid step because I'd thought at first that it was a black ribbon.  \\nI should probably explain: our mom took her intuition to a higher level by believing that a finding a black ribbon on the ground meant that someone was going to die.  The \u201ctheory\u201d behind that had something to do with how, when her father had died, she'd worn a black ribbon around her arm for a year.  This was too far into the world of hoodoo nonsense for me, but for a moment when I'd seen that glove I'd been frozen by panic.  Aria must have thought the same thing, she hadn't wanted to go anywhere near it.   \\nSo now here we are, following two strangers' increasingly alarming story in footprints, and my inner voice is telling me to stop, stop, STOP!   Perhaps I'm being paranoid: it's getting dark and I'm scared and jumpy and I don't kn-\\n\u201cOh holy shit, is that blood?\u201d\\nAria's voice cuts through the frozen air so suddenly I bump right into her and we slip on the icy path.   I  peak over her shoulder and see it: a gaudy bright splash of crimson glittering on top of the snow.  My breath flinches at the sight and I instinctively reach out and tug on her coat, pulling her back a little.\\n\u201cKat, I don't...\u201d  Aria starts to say something to me, but her voice fades with uncertainty. \\nI blink several times, just to be sure I'm not seeing things.  It's blood definitely and it's not a small amount by any means.  It's about three feet wide and fanned out away from us in an broad spray.\\n\u201cThe footprints go right through it...\u201d she whispers.  We've met hunters out on these trails before, but it's not in season right now and most of the forest animals are hibernating anyhow.\\nI take a moment to scan the area before figuring out what to do.  The snowfall in this ravine is quite heavy and the footprints have sunk in deep.  I follow them with my eyes and they lead to behind the blood puddle, opposite where we're standing, to another disturbed area of the ground. \\n\\n\\n\\n[[Investigate the bloody snow.|S0_P5]]\\n[[Continue following the path down the hill.|S0_P6]]\\n[[Turn back the way you came.|S0_P7]]\\n\\n/% 1) Investigate the bloody snow. ->S0_P5\\n2) Continue following the path down the hill. ->S0_P6\\n3) Turn back the way you came. ->S0_P7 %/ \\n/%  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %/",

My only hope is that the trees are quite close together and the frequently shifting cloud cover blocks out enough of the moon that I won't be as easy to shoot as if I was in the bright open.\\nDuring the moments when the visibility is higher I notice that there are numerous other prints running through these woods.  Most are small like from a deer but there's the occasional larger print that mingles in as well.  A bear or a wildcat perhaps?  It doesn't really matter, they're not the predator I'm most afraid of out here.\\nAt the start of my flight I'd seen the flickers of the Younger Man's flashlight jump across the trees, sometimes gliding to a branch or trunk above my head but somehow always just missing the chance to give me away.  I'm breathing too hard to hear him but at least his flashlight is a double-edged sword that lets me track his movements as well as he can track mine.\\nI keep low, half crouched and bent at the waist.  Moving like this is slower than a full-out sprint but speed could lead to sloppiness and one trip or stumble could be the end for me.\\nThe one thing I don't do is turn around and see how close my hunter is.  If he should be so lucky to get a clear shot into my back I'd rather not know that it's about to happen.  Better to simply die instantly and not know that I'd made a mistake that got both me and my sister killed.\\n As I move deeper  the flashes of light become less and less until they stop completely.  In other circumstances this might have been a source of relief, but here my instincts are screaming at me not to let my guard down and to keep moving. \\n Surely it can't be that easy to escape, right?  My instincts are telling me that something's wrong and I need to keep running.  \u201cRun.  Run.  Keep going.  Don't stop now.\u201d\\nSo I keep on moving.  Crouching, scrambling, ducking and weaving.  Time passes by, spent in a mindless run that simultaneously seems to take forever and be over in seconds.  As I get deeper into the woods I try to memorize any sort of landmarks so that I can find my way back. \\nThe trees are huge here and block out most of the moonlight, filling the forest with inky black pools of shadows that seem to shift every time I look away.  It's highly unnerving and I desperately wish I had any sort of real survival skills.  This shit would never happen to Bear Grylls.   He'd have found a way to hot wire their truck or turn the Younger Man's hunting jacket into a wind sail powered by rage...  \\nYes, I know I'm babbling.  I'm trying to distract myself because I can't quite face the reality of what's really happening.\\nFocus.  I need to focus.  Okay,  I'm following a sort of trail, probably an animal path or maybe just a more worn area of the ground.  It's significantly easier to move in but also the obvious choice for me to take.  I might be better off breaking away from the path and cutting across through the woods to find a place to hide.  Right at the base of each tree is a bald area of needles, if I'm careful I can use those to hide my footprints until I'm far enough away.  It'll be slower going but maybe it's the safer choice.  \\n\\n\\n\\n[[Keep following the trail.  Speed and distance are more important.|S3_P17]]\\n[[Get off the trail and find a place to hide.

All of that good stuff but my willpower is stronger and if I keep my mind focused I can drown it out for a while.  \\nSo where am I, anyhow?

They knocked us out and drove us here but I didn't come to in the truck so it couldn't have been that long of a drive.  It's still night so it can't be more than a few hours away, right?

Now the clouds have shifted in the sky slightly and the moonlight reflecting off the ice brightens up the darkness enough so I can see a little better.  I'm standing on a covered wooden porch and behind me is a small yard is encircled by a high fence.  Deep snow banks are piled up along its edges but to my right is a pile of firewood logs that I could probably use to climb over to the other side.  Beyond it I can see the outlines of tall pine trees sticking up over the fence.  At the far side of the yard is a small shed and in front of it is a chopping block with an axe buried into it and several large piles of dirt.  \\nI glance back up at the house behind me.  It's a large three story log cabin with a balcony and railing wrapping around the top floor but from my current low vantage point I can't tell any more details.  \\nI'm debating sneaking back inside and trying to get Aria when I hear the crunch of footsteps.

I hurry to the shed and try to drag open the sliding metal door at the front.  It's locked.  There's another padlock at the top but of course I don't have the keys.\\nI turn around to leave and immediately stop in my tracks.  From this angle I can see now that the dirt piles are in the shape of graves.  Fresh graves, with the soil still holding enough residual warmth to partially melt the night's recent snowfall.  Two bigger and one small, like it would fit a child.  Worse still is the last one which is still an open pit in the ground. Some horrible voice inside me tells me that one was meant for me.  \\nI'm momentarily paralyzed by that idea, no, by that absolute certainty, that for a second my mind goes completely blank.  Then there's a sudden noise from behind me and instinct takes over.  I throw myself at the ground just as a bullet flies by me and into the shed, ricocheting with a sharp metallic bang.  The Younger Man's by the corner of the house, reloading his rifle.  A dark black stain runs down the front of his jacket from where I must have broken his nose when I kicked him.\\nGo to the trees!  The thought is singular and absolute.  I leap to my feet and sprint to the wood pile by the fence line, adrenaline surging me forward so quickly I barely even struggle in the icy quicksand.  \\nJust as I'm leaping one-handed over the top another bullet explodes in the logs under me, spraying me with splinters.  Somehow he must have missed me yet again.  Maybe he's still a somewhat blinded by the lights from inside like I was.\\nI fall into a pile of deep snow on the other side.  The drifts right through here are much thicker and give me a little padding. The forest's directly in front of me and I scramble back to my feet and run the short ways to it. \\n As soon as I reach the first tree the drifts become shallower and easier to move through.  I push in a few more feet and crouch down in the darkness.  I can't see the Younger Man but that means he can't see me either, right?\\nWrong.  A cold beam of light suddenly gleams on the trees in front of me.  Shit, he must have a flashlight!\\n His shape drops down over the fence where I'd jumped from and the light flicks across the trees above my head.\\nI don't have any other choice: I turn and run deeper into the woods, away from the house and Aria.\\n\\n\\n\\n[[Continue. |S3_P16]]\\n\\n/% \\tCONT ->S3_P16\\t %/\\n\\n/%  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %/",

In front of him is the Older Man, leaning on his metal cane with one hand and the railing with the other.  \\nHe stops at the bottom step and stares at us huddled together in the corner.  \\n\u201cWell there you two are,\u201d he says with a laugh, \u201chope we didn't scare you too much, keeping you down here in the dark all by your lonesome.\u201d  I feel Aria's shoulder twitch and jump like she wants to run but I hold her down.\\nThe men step down into the room with us and I notice the Younger Man's carrying both our purses and my medical bag in his free hand.\\n\u201cCome on up and say hi, don't be shy,\u201d the Older Man says to us, slapping on his thigh like he's calling a dog over.  Still holding on tightly to Aria, I carefully rise to our feet, keeping my back flush with the wall.  I glance around the room quickly, seeing what it looks like in full. \\nThe room's smaller than it had felt in the dark.  The only light is coming from a single long florescent light fixture mounted on the ceiling next to the large pipe.  To the left of us is are the pillars with chains and the kitchen chairs.  Across the room from them is the wooden kitchen table and behind it is the staircase going up and the armchair.\\n\u201cOkay ladies,\u201d the Older Man addresses us, tipping his head down low so his cowboy hat blocks his face again.  \u201cYou two are going to be difficult about this, aren't you?\u201d  He walks a step towards the table and snags the leg of it with the hook on his cane, dragging it closer too him. I'm surprised he's strong enough to do that.\\n\u201cThat's alright though,\u201d he continues, sitting on the edge and pulling a cigarette out of his pocket.  \u201cWe don't mind a doing little work, do we Son?\u201d\\nThe question's directed at the Younger Man who merely grunts in response.  He takes a few steps toward us and Aria and I shift away along the wall before bumping into the nearer of the kitchen chairs chained to the pillars.   He stops in front of us, out of arms reach but effectively blocking our route to the staircase and the only exit from the room.\\n\\n\\n\\n[[Continue.|S2_P33]]\\n\\n/% \\tCONT -> S2_P33\\t %/\\n\\n/%  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %/",

I'm hoping the room will continue on and lead us somewhere deeper where we can find a spot to hide until... until what? I don't know.  I don't have a plan and even if I did it wouldn't matter because we just ran into a wall.  It's not actually a wall but rather something sort of springy  but unyielding.  I reach out and feel it: wires, criss crossing each other in a diamond pattern.\\n\u201cWhat is this stuff?\u201d Aria whispers and I hear her shaking it.\\nIt's some sort of chicken wire screen that we can't push through.  Like some sort of cage?  \\nWe feel our way to the right, following the screen to where it makes a corner meeting with the wall.  This is the best we can do to hide, it seems. All we can do it crouch here and listen.\\nI hold onto Aria's arm, both holding her back from doing something reckless and closer to me for protection. \\nTwo men's voices.  Of course it must be those two from earlier, who else could it possibly be? \\nWe stay motionless and every sound coming from us and the floor above is intensified with our concentration.  The voices are moving in circles.  First one area of the floor, then the other.  I can't make out the words, but the tone is light hearted.  One of them laughs.  It's an awful, hollow wheeze.  The Older Man probably?  The Younger didn't sound like that. \\nI hear the hollow click-click of that metal walking stick.  It echoes with a springiness that only a wood floor could provide.\\nDoes that mean we're in an actual house?  I'd been thinking it was somewhere industrial because of that giant water pipe. \\nThe voices stop at the left corner of the room, above where the railing goes up.  I hear the Older Man's voice followed by the sound of something heavy being dragged away.\\n\\n\\n\\n[[Continue.|S2_P31]]\\n\\n/% \\tCONT -> S2_P31\\t %/\\n\\n/%  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %/",

There are no power lines, the radio's shit, and earlier when I was by the cliff I didn't see any other lights.  Once I get Aria back I need to figure out how to get us out of here.  Walking out probably isn't an option.  I'm sure Aria's... fine.  But I don't know how more many miles I can go in conditions like this.  Unless I can miraculously get the keys and take this truck our next best bet is to get this phone and run off and hide somewhere and call for help.

All of the electric lights are off and I try to remember the layout of this floor from when I ran out of the basement.\\n\u201cGet up,\u201d the Younger Man orders and he grabs me from under my armpits and hauls me fully to my feet.  He rather violently rips the tape off from my wrists and I take the rest off myself as he presses the end of the rifle between my shoulder blades and directs me to walk forward deeper into the room.\\nI tentatively step forward, afraid of what I might see beyond the open scaffolding connecting the kitchen and back room.  He has us follow the bloody trail and at one point he pauses to grab a candle and bring it with him.  The trail ends at a shape lying on an arrangement of cushions on the couch, covered by a blanket.  For a second all I can do is stare.  Then I see the black cowboy boots peaking out from the bottom of the makeshift bed.\\n\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d I turn to face the Younger Man, in the very least he owes me some answers about why he's brought me back here.  Now that my eyes have adjusting once again to the minimal lighting I can see that the room's been trashed.  It wasn't exactly a Martha Stewart moment before, but now even more of the furniture's been turned over and scattered around the floor. \\nInstead of answering he steps away and moves sideways to an end table in the corner, avoiding making eye contact with me.  He opens the large bottom drawer and pulls out my medical bag.

I again consider the possibility of trying to run off as soon as his back is turned but would that really do me any good?  Even if I managed to get away I'd be right back to where I'd started a few hours ago: running through the woods.  Except this time I'd be half tied up and even further away from finding Aria and getting her out of here.\\nHe directs me up the steps to the front porch and I get a closer look at where the balcony had collapsed.  Shards of glass are sprayed over the wooden planks and they must have come from one of the upper windows because all the ones  on the lower floor are boarded up.  A section of railing has also fallen down and collapsed through a hole in the porch canopy.  Next to it is large pool of blood that's spreading accords the porch and dribbling off the ends.  I stop walking when I see it.  It can't be very old or it would have soaked in deeper into the floor boards. \\nThen I see the twin lines of blood leading from the pool towards the front door and I turn to face the Younger Man.\\n\u201cWhere's my sister?\u201d I ask quietly.\\nHe pauses as he unlocks the front door and stares at a gap in the boards over the glass. \\n\u201cShe's fine,\u201d he eventually says.  He slips the keys back into his vest pocket and puts his hand on the door knob but doesn't open it yet.  Instead he stares down at his feet where the bloody streaks are and steps back.  The strangest expression is on his face and once again I wish Aria was here to read him.\\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d I ask again, more insistently than last time.  \\nI can't tell if he's angry or regretful or what but his sudden 180 in temperament is profoundly alarming.  \u201cWhy am I here?\u201d I demand when he doesn't answer me for a second time.  If my sister's dead why did he bring me back here?  He has to know she's the only leverage he can use on me.  So she has to still be alive, right?\\n\u201cGet inside,\u201d he says finally, throwing the front door open.  I take a single step forward and pause again. The blood trail disappears into darkness.  Why are all the lights off?\\nI look up at him with a  frown and am about to protest when his patience apparently give out.  He grabs me by my bound arms and throws me inside.  I have no way of catching myself but I manage to twist in mid air and land on my butt instead of my face.  I'm awkwardly trying to get to my knees when he steps inside behind me and shuts the door with the deadbolt.\\n\\n\\n\\n[[Continue.|S4-P14]]\\n\\n/% \\tCONT -> S4-P14\\t %/\\n\\n/%  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %/",

I don't think I'm interested in doing that.\u201d \\nOuch.  What an awkward way to say that.  Aria winces next to me and I push against her, backing us both away.\\n\u201cLadies...\u201d the man calls out, matching our steps backward.  \u201cLet's not make this difficult.\u201d  He twirls his rifle like a baton but his eyes don't share the same playful demeanor.  \\nI look back at Aria and she shakes her head and mouths \u201cno\u201d at me.  She's right, this is ridiculous but I'm worried that I'm only going to make it worse for us.  I tug on her sleeve and whisper \u201cc'mon.\u201d  Hurry up and we can leave.\\n\u201cOh Jesus Christ,\u201d the man mutters to himself at our hesitancy.  For a second I think he's going to let us go.  Then, quick as lightning, he lunges out and grabs Aria's forearm, wrenching her away from me.  I scream and jump at him, but he violently jams the butt of his rifle into my gut.  I collapse on the ground, wheezing and holding my side.  \\nHoly shit that hurts!  For just a moment I can't even move, it hurts so much.\\nAria shrieks as he rips her coat off her and shoves her away from him, sending her face first into the snow.  She scrambles back to me and pulls on my shoulders, helping me stand up.  \u201cKat?\u201d\\n\u201cFine.  I'm fine.\u201d  I hiss breathlessly.  At least I don't think anything's broken.\\nThe man tosses her coat down onto the ground in front of him. It falls in a messy pile and the bright red color against the snow is disturbingly reminiscent of the blood splatter behind us.  \\n\u201cWell that was unnecessary,\u201d he mutters, wiping at a split on his lip where she must have hit him.  \u201cAria, sweetie,\u201d he calls out, \u201ctell your friend to hand over her coat.  Now.\u201d  \\nHe doesn't have to say anything else.  I want to get us out of here as quickly as I can.  If he wants my coat whatever, just take the damn thing.\\nI hurriedly unzip it, my ribs are still aching too much to do it myself.  Aria wads it up and tosses it at him, her anger returning now that she sees I'm okay.  He grabs it from the air and starts patting it down.\\n\u201cWe're going to fucking freeze out here!\u201d Aria shouts as we scramble away from him.  \u201cWas that you plan this whole time?!\u201d\\nHe pauses and glances up at us from under the brim of his cap.  \u201cCome again?\u201d he asks, his light hearted tone returning.\\n\u201cWe don't know where our car is you asshole!  You're going to make us stay out here all night without our coats!\u201d  \\nI grab her arms and try to pull her back.  I don't care about any of that right now; I just want to leave.\\n\u201cYour car?\u201d he raises his eyebrows.  \u201cIt's up over there.\u201d  He gestures with the rifle at the hill to our left but all I see is more trees.  \u201cGo up there a short ways and you'll find the main path.  You're only about a half mile from where you parked.\u201d  He starts going through my coat pockets, ignoring us completely.\\nSeriously?  We were almost there?

Before he'd seemed reluctant to kill me directly but perhaps his Dad had given him the all clear or whatever that call he'd gotten was about.  \\nThe lake begins to narrow the further along it I go.  Hopefully soon I'll find the stream that feeds into it and I can cross to the other side and start working my way over to that road on the far hill.  I neither see nor hear any sign of the Younger Man behind me but I doubt it can be this easy to avoid him.  The avalanche covered a wide area and it could take his quite a while to work his way through it all.  And here by the lake the grass is dead but still springy and I'm barely leaving any prints at all.\\nI reach a rotten poplar tree that had partially fallen into the lake and as I weave through it's tangle of branches I look back behind me.  The moon is fully out and now that the clouds have moved on it's almost bright enough to read.  I actually wish it was darker, which is an odd thought given that I'd spent the last few hours hating the darkness, but if it was cloudy he'd have to use his flashlight and I'd at least know where he is.\\nPast the tree is a wider flat area where some underground spring must feed into the lake.  The drifts are very deep here and I step down into it carefully, expecting a wet bog underneath.  Fortunately the ground is frozen solid but the snow comes almost to my waist.  \\nNo, I can't go this way.\\nI push back up onto the ledge I came from and start heading inland, away from the lake.  There's a trail here but with no prints so I can't tell if it's from people or animals. \\nA short ways forward and my foot gets caught in something hidden under the icy top layer.

I assumed it was empty.\u201d\\n\u201cLet's go find out what's over there.\u201d I try to keep my voice conversational, but in truth I'm more than a little scared to investigate the unknown.  As irrational as it may seem, this corner we've been in since waking up has been verified as \u201csafe\u201d and I'm not sure I want to know what else's out here.\\nThe water pipe leads straight into a small hole in the left wall and continues on to whatever's past it on the other side.  The electrical cable follows it but right near the end it bends to what's now our right, opposite of where the armchair Aria found is.  I follow it first, swatting through the air like I'm clearing invisible cobwebs, and Aria follows close behind with her hand on my shoulder.\\nA few more steps and my foot hits something solid.  I kick it a few times but it doesn't move.  Aria comes around to my side.\\n\u201cIt's wooden,\u201d she tells me.  Thunk thunk.  \u201cUm... I think it's a staircase.\u201d She shifts further away from me and it gives a loud creak as she puts her weight on it.  The noise sounds absolutely booming against the intense silence.\\n\u201cShould we go up?\u201d she whispers and I step forward, feeling the handrail rise up at a steep angle. \\nI take a moment to think it over. Okay, we don't know what's up there.  It could be an ambush or it could be another pitch black room.  I'd feel a lot better if we had something, anything, to arm ourselves with.  Just in case.  So maybe we should finish checking down here first. On the other hand we might be wasting valuable time. There could just be more of nothing down here and-\\nA sound suddenly comes from up above us.  A distant \u201cthump\u201d noise and its the first we've heard from anywhere else since we woke up.\\nI grab Aria's arm and pull her back down off the step.  It creaks again loudly.  \u201cShould we hide?\u201d I whisper.\\n\u201cWhere? We don't know what else is down here.\u201d\\nI look around the room.  Or more correctly I turn my head in different directions in the darkness.  Nope, still can't see shit.  \\nAnd then there's another noise from above us.  This one was slightly closer than the last and is followed by a sort of \u201cbang\u201d sound and... voices?

Some sort of cable is attached to the roof and is running from the left to the right of the room.\\n\u201cAria? I think I found some wiring,\u201d  I say. It feels like the basic two conduit electrical wiring we helped install in our old garage when we were converting it into a room.  Next to it is a large plastic pipe about 6 inches in diameter.  Part way along it is a joint that's leaking and causing the dripping sound I heard earlier.  I catch a droplet in my fingers and sniff it.  \\n\u201cThere's a water pipe also,\u201d I tell her, tapping it with my knuckle.  \u201cIt's a pretty big one, a lot larger than the one in our house.\u201d\\nI hear her stand up and walk toward my voice.\\n\u201cA water pipe?\u201d she asks.  \u201cSo we're in some sort of... treatment plant?

I force myself to go mostly limp and let gravity take me where it wants me to go. \\n I hear a gunshot at one point but it's quickly drowned out by a massive rumbling sound.  I feel the ground start to slip away under me as I and I realize his shooting must have triggered an avalanche that I'm now caught in.  \\nEverything around me turns to strobe: black sky, white snow, black sky, white snow, black, white, black, white.  Soon it's more white than black as the mass of ice piles on top of me.  It's getting harder to breathe so I try to swim through it, letting my bodies natural sense of direction tell me which way is up.  \\nA sudden impact hits my bruised ribs and I cry out, only to get a mouthful of snow and debris.  I must have hit a tree and I try to grab out blindly and catch it but the weight bearing down on me is too much and it gets pulled out of my hands.\\nAnother awful tumbling minute and I feel the avalanche wave start to slow and there's a sensation of less steepness.  I guess I'm nearing the bottom of the hill?  I try to force my eyes open that I hadn't realized were clenched shut but everything in darkness.  I must be at least a foot under the surface and I start kicking out wildly. I'm not sure which way is up anymore but I know that as soon as the avalanche comes to a stop the snow is going to settle and I'll be trapped under it.  This is my only chance to get out.  \\nMy elbow hits something solid and I feel bark and I grab onto it and cling.  The momentum tries to pull me down with it again but it's lost its' strength and I manage to hold on this time, wrapping my arms around the trunk in a desperate bear hug.\\nAnother moment and then the sound is gone and there's nothing but stillness.  I briefly wonder if I'm still alive but then everything that's taken a hit starts to hurt too much for me to be dead. \\nI wriggle and try to pull myself up against the tree trunk.  It had partially blocked the avalanche and the snow on the downhill side is lighter.  I can first feel a tiny bit of give above me, then a little more, and finally my fingers swish through the open air.\\nI pull myself up out of the drift.  Luckily I was only a little under the surface and I can't help but wonder if I must look like a white zombie rising from the grave.  When I'm finally free I lie flat,sprawled out on my back in the snow and try to recover.  I stare up at my breath fogging over the stars and I feel more exhausted than I ever had before in my life.  \\nTurns out falling down a mountainside really takes it out of you.

Below me is a snowy valley spiraling out from the bottom of the cliff.  No other houses or lights in sight.\\n\u201cSTOP!\u201d The Younger Man shouts at me and I glance over my shoulder as I keep running.  He's charging out of the woods after me, gun drawn but not actively trying to shoot me.  \\nIt turns out going this way wasn't this wasn't a good idea after all.  The cliff's descent is much sharper than it had first appeared to be and the snow is up over my knees and as thick and heavy as wet sand.  \\n\u201cI said fucking stop!\u201d he yells at me again, sounding both furious and out of breath.  At least he's having as difficult a time moving in this sludge as I am.  \\nHowever, he's still much taller and stronger than I am and he quickly begins to close the distance between us.  So I do the only thing I can: I take my chances and jump off the edge of the cliff, tucking my arms and legs into my chest like I'm doing a cannon ball into a pool.  I hear him shout something again but I start to tumble rapidly a short ways down the hill before coming to an abrupt stop.  \\nI hadn't seen it from higher up (actually I hadn't really looked and instead just jumped blindly) but there is a little ledge in the cliff side that I've landed on.  It doesn't go anywhere but there's a rocky overhang that I can crouch under.  I squeeze into it just as the beam of the flashlight shines on the slope next to me.\\n\u201cYou're a fucking idiot,\u201d he calls out.  \u201cWhere you gonna go now?  Didn't think about that, did you?\u201d  Even if he can't see me he must know where I am because the snow below me is  smooth and distinctly unbroken.\\n\u201cDo you have any idea how much of a pain in my ass you've been?\u201d The beam of light flickers erratically as I imagine he shifts to holding the flashlight with his chin or knees.   I hear the deliberate cock of his rifle and I guess he's trying to scare me out of my hiding spot with the sound.\\nI stay quiet, pressing as deep into the shallow cave as I can.  He's right: I'm in trapped here but he's about 12 feet above me and can't get to me easily either.\\n\u201cGodfuckingdamnit!\u201d he curses after a moment of silence.  I hear him shift and the light moves ands settles on a different spot of the cliff.  He must have set it down on the ground for some reason and I wonder if he's not going to try to shoot at me through the rocks.\\nThen I hear the strangest sound: electronic beeping.  What the-\\nIs he... He's... he's making a phone call?  What the-\\n\u201cDad, I got her,\u201d he voice says from directly up above me.  \u201cDo you want me to kill her now or try to bring her back?\u201d  A pause. I shift slightly, trying to find if there's some angle where I can see him.\\n\u201cDad? Dad, what's going on?\u201d His voice elevates with the last two words.  He almost sounds... concerned?  \u201cDad?!  I can't hear you!  What are you-\u201d\\nHis voice ends abruptly.  I guess the call got disconnected.  I'm surprised there's reception out here at all.  \\n\u201cShit...\u201d he mutters under his breath.

I risk a millisecond glance behind me and see him standing there on the cliff edge where I'd come out.  He's watching me with his rifle drawn but not aiming at me.  Instead, he takes something out of his pocket, stares at it for a moment, and then puts it back.  Huh?  After a moment he turns back and disappears into the shadows of the trees again.\\nI keep pushing forward and I begin to think that I may have made the wrong choice picking to go this way.  The cliff edge is becoming narrower and narrower and there's a nearly impassible wall of dormant thorns and shrubs preventing me from going back into the forest.  If I tried to go through it now I'd get stuck like a moth on flypaper.\\nA few more meters and the cliff makes a bend.  I round it and abruptly come to an almost dead-end: Another cliff line intersects this one, rising maybe 20 feet above my head in a sheer wall.  The brambles go right up to it and the only way forward is on a narrow and icy ledge.  Down below me is darkness but like before the angle of the descent is slightly more mild, like a double diamond ski slope instead of an absolutely sheer fall.\\nJust as I'm considering my limited options a light falls on me from up above.\\n\u201cFreeze.\u201d  The Younger Man's voice is both breathless and furious.  \\nHe's up on the ledge above me and he must have known he could catch me here at this corner.  Holding my fingers in front of my eyes I look up at him, wondering why he doesn't shoot me now and be done with it.  \\n\u201cDon't fucking move,\u201d he orders and the light shifts slightly.  I hear the click of his gun and guess that he must be having trouble holding both it and the flashlight at the same time.\\nRight at this moment I'm oddly not as scared as I was earlier.  In fact the main emotion I'm feeling is intense anger laced with a bitter web of regret.\\n\u201cWhat the hell are you waiting for?!\u201d I demand, glaring into the blinding light to where I guess his eyes must be.  \u201cEither fucking shoot me or leave me the fuck alone!\u201d  \\nTo emphasize my point I stomp forward on the ledge, clinging to it with my left hand and sheer willpower.\\n\u201cDo you have any idea how much of a pain in my ass you've been?!\u201d he calls out, the light flickering erratically as I imagine he shifts to holding it with his chin or knees.  He cocks the rifle deliberately in warning but I ignore him, continuing to inch forward into the unknown.  It's not until I hear an odd beeping that I pause and look up again.  The flashlight must be propped on the ground because I'm largely in darkness now but his face is illuminated by a bluish light.\\nHe's... he's making a phone call?  What the-\\n\u201cDad, I got her,\u201d he says, not caring that I'm trying to get away.  \u201cDo you want me to kill her or bring her back?\u201d  A pause.

Suddenly the ground gives out from under me and I fall gracelessly onto my butt, my feet kicking out into open air.\\nThe clear space ahead wasn't a field after all, but rather a cliff line that ended the forest abruptly.  Beyond it the blue white was from the distant peak of another mountain.  This was what my hunter was trying to herd me to: he wanted me to blindly plunge off here and fall to my death.

Part way down it is a  heavy wooden table pushed against the wall and sitting between two ceiling support columns.  The top surface of the table is heavily scuffed and below it are two drawers, both of which are empty.\\nAt the far end of the room is an area caged off by double layers of chicken wire and a metal screen.  It has wooden support beams running from floor to ceiling and a door is crudely attached to one of the posts.  I push on it but it's also secured with a padlock.  \\n\u201cLet's keep an eye out for a key for this,\u201d I comment to Aria.  \\nShe presses the lighter next to the screen and we try to see through it.\\n\u201cLooks like gardening tools mostly,\u201d she says.  I can faintly see the outline of shovels, a rake, a small saw, and a few other things hung on the back wall. \\n\u201cWhy would these be locked up?\u201d\\nI'm getting that sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach again.  Pity we can't get in there now, some of that stuff we might have needed. \\nA sound  suddenly comes from up above us.  A distant \u201cthump\u201d noise and its the first we've heard since waking up.\\n\u201cShould we hide?\u201d I whisper to her.\\nShe quickly searches around the room.  \u201cWhere? There's no place to go.\u201d\\n\u201cMaybe here in the corner?  This is a far as we can get away from the steps.\u201d\\nAnother creak from above us and we both immediately snap silent.  I hold onto Aria's arm and we listen intently, afraid to move or even to breathe. Two men's voices.  Of course it must be those two from earlier, who else could it possibly be?\\nAria pulls on me, trying to drag me backwards further into the room.  I shake my head. \u201cHold on.\u201d  I say it so quietly it's barely audible but she must have heard me because she stops dead still.\\nWe stay motionless, every sound coming from us and the floor above intensified with our concentration.  The voices are moving in circles.  First one area of the floor, then the other.  I can't make out the words, but the tone is light hearted.  One of them laughs.  It's an awful, hollow wheeze.  The Older Man probably?  The Younger didn't sound like that.\\nI hear the hollow click-click of that metal walking stick.  It echoes with a springiness that only a wood floor could provide.\\nDoes that mean we're in an actual house?  I'd been thinking it was somewhere industrial because of that giant water pipe.\\nThe voices stop at the left corner of the room, above where the railing goes up.  I hear the Older Man's voice then a heavy dragging sound.  \\n\u201cThey're coming down here!\u201d Aria whispers, tugging on my sleeve.  \u201cWe need to hide!\u201d\\nI frantically search around the corner we're in.  There's really no place to hide that won't be blatantly obvious. \\n  \u201cThe lighter!\u201d  I hiss. We have to turn it off.\\nShe blows the it out and the room falls into darkness once more.

I pick it up to turn it over and investigate the bottom at the bottom, but it's tied down to the floor with something.  I feel around and find a heavy chain attached to the legs and leading off away to the right.  What in the hell?\\nI start to follow it, crawling on my hands and knees, when I bump into something solid.  \\n\u201cCrap,\u201d I mutter, feeling around for where I dropped the chain.\\n\u201cKat?\u201d\\n\u201cYeah, I'm...uh.  The chair was tied down and I bumped into something.\u201d\\n\u201cInto what?\u201d I hear her rustle with the stuff she found on the armchair.\\nI find the chain and follow it back up.  It's looped around what feels like a concrete column.  The chain makes two twists and runs up above my head.\\n\u201cSome sort of pillar.  Why don't you come over here, I don't want us to get separated.\u201d\\nMore rustling.  \u201cYeah, ok.  There wasn't much over here except some clothes and a few books.\u201d  I hear her patter in my general direction.\\nThe chain goes part way up the column where it makes another circle and threads through a metal loop.  It continues away from the column and leads out further away from us.  \\n\u201cHere,\u201d I say to Aria as she catches up to me.  I lead her fingers to the chain.  \u201cLet's follow it.\u201d\\nIt leads a few feet forward to another chair.  It feels about the same as the first one and the chain continues on, climbing up from the ground to someplace higher.  I stand up and something brushes the top of my head.  I give a little squeak and crouch low.\\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Aria whispers, reaching out and finding my shoulder.\\nI carefully reach back up, swatting at the air until my fingers brush against something metal.  I run the pad of my thumb over it.  \u201cThere's some... hooks here.\u201d  I feel around again, counting three of them hanging from the roof.  \\n\u201cHooks?\u201d She squeezes me tighter.\\n\u201cUm... yeah.  Like, plant hooks.  I guess.\u201d  I'm beginning to get a sickly feeling in the pit of my stomach but I don't want Aria to get nervous.  Hell, for all I know it really is plant hooks hanging here... next to some chairs with chains...\\nOkay, let's move on.\\nWe very hesitantly follow the chain around the chair deeper into the room, holding hands just like we used to do when we were children and we didn't want to get separated.  This chain attaches to another column slightly further into the room.  More chains are wrapped around the column except these don't connect to another chair but are dangling freely.  \\nAria shifts next to me and I hear them jangle. \\n\u201cThey all have this weird loop at the bottom,\u201d she says, handing me one of them.\\nThe loop is also made of metal, about an inch and a half wide, and it has some sort of hinge that's closed by a small padlock.\\n\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Aria hisses.  \u201cIs this... is this a manacle?\u201d \\nI blink at it in disbelief. A gesture that's no doubt lost in the darkness.  \u201cYes?\u201d  I'm guessing.  \\nWhere the hell do you even find manacles outside of an old movie?  What kind of person even has manacles in their base- \\nNevermind.  I'm going to stop that line of thought right here.\\n Aria squeezes my hand even tighter.\\n\u201cKat, I hate this place.\u201d  \\nI couldn't be more speechless in agreement.  \u201cLet's keep going and get out of here.\u201d\\nWe start to cautiously push ahead, further into the room and away from the columns, when a sound  suddenly comes from up above us.  A distant \u201cthump\u201d noise and its the first we've heard from anywhere else since we woke up.\\n\u201cShould we hide?\u201d I whisper to her.\\n\u201cWhere? We don't know what else is down here.\u201d\\nI look around the room.  Or more correctly I turn my head in different directions in the darkness.  Nope, still can't see shit.  \\nAnd then there's another noise from above us.  This one was slightly closer than the last and is followed by a sort of \u201cbang\u201d sound and... voices?

A small top, probably a child's size. Some sort of sweater.  A large pair of pants, probably men's.  Nothing in the pockets.  Something heavier with buttons and a zipper.  A jacket?  No, nothing in the pockets either.\\nI place them on the floor next to us and reach out and find the edge of the armchair.  It feels like leather and it's shoved against the wall.

The floor is gritty and damp with a strong mold smell.  The wall feels like it's made out of concrete blocks and I try to develop a picture of the space in my mind.  Are we in some sort of industrial building?  I hear an infrequent drip-drip from somewhere to my right and a very distant hum from somewhere above us.\\nI carefully rise to my feet, running my fingers along the wall behind me in case the roof's not high enough for me to stand.  It is, but it's still a low roof: I'm not very tall but I can touch the ceiling with my arms not quite fully extended above my head.\\nAria makes a sound off to the left.\\n\u201cKat?\u201d she whispers.  \u201cThere's something soft over here.\u201d\\nOh god... \u201cAria, don't-\u201d\\n\u201cNo no, its not like that.

I huddle inside it like a cloak, keeping my back pressed tightly away from the open darkness, and I listen.\\nNothing.  Not a sound.\\nTotal quiet and that's even worse than if I had heard a noise because at least I would know something.  The woods should have sound, right?

I should be able to hear deer shuffling, or squirrels in the trees, or possibly a raccoon coming out to see what the hell I'm doing in his home.\\nIt's so unfair.  Humans aren't meant to be in situations like this.  Our senses are so weak compared to most other animals, and especially at night we're at our most vulnerable.

That means he's out here, doesn't it?  I know it.  It's through a pure, instinctual certainty that I just know that he's somewhere close by.\\nSo what should I do?  I could keep running, I've caught my breath a little and I could keep going and going until  I find a road.  But out here in the woods it can be miles between roads and at this time of night I doubt anyone with good intentions would be out driving.\\nAnd what about Aria?  This is the first time since we separated I've let myself fully think about what she must be going through.  Are they torturing her now?  Is she already dead?  What if she somehow escaped like I did and is now out in these very same woods just like me, terrified and close to hysterical and at a total loss of what to do next?  What if she's looking for me?\\nIt's the thought that she might somehow still be alive is enough to force me out of both my thoughts and my hiding spot.  I can't give up now.  She needs me and I'm her older sister and it's just something I have to do. Maybe if I double back now my hunter will keep going forward and never know that he's passed my trail.  Surely he won't think I'm so bold as to return right back to the house he chased me from?  \\nI start to crawl out from under the root pile and peek back the way I came.  Trees and darkness.\\nSuddenly the thunderclap of the rifle explodes through the silence of the woods so abruptly that I can't stop my scream.  Snow and dirt showers down, choking me, and for a moment I wonder if he didn't miss on purpose. \\n I leap forward, belly flopping into an unexpectedly deep drift before catching my balance and taking off on the run again.

I choose the fourth close pine tree I pass, remembering some random tidbit my sister had once told me about how people always go for the third choice or something something about humans liking the number 3 so if I ever have to guess a random number I should go for 4 instead. \\nI take a running leap off the trail, trying to jump over the deep snow drifts and prevent any marks from giving away my change in direction.  I land in the clear spot of needles, churning them up slightly with my impact but I quickly smooth it back over before ducking under a pine bough and crawling out the other side.  \\nThis spot was a good choice, there are several smaller pines that form a long line down towards a gulch and I can easily gain some distance from the path without having to worry about leaving footprints.  I pause briefly when I come to the last tree before the woods opens up again.  I risk sticking my head out and glancing about but I don't see any lights or movement.  Nothing but shadowed trees and the faint outline of the shape of the land.\\nMaybe he's turned around?  Decided that he'd lost me and has gone back to the house?  Or maybe he's figured out that his flashlight's giving him away, and if he wants to sneak up on me he'd be better off doing what I am: sneaking through the shadows and trying to pick the right path?\\nIt's a disturbing thought and it's enough to prompt me to crawl out from this line of trees and go a little further away from the main trail.  I don't want to go too far and get lost (if I'm not already).  I need to find a spot that's slightly better than this and hide for a few minutes, then I'll start working my way back to Aria.\\nThe gulch I'm in now runs perpendicular to the line of pines I was just in.  To the left it goes gently up a hill and to the right it's angled more downwards before making a sharp curve into shadows.  I hesitate for a moment, trying to get my bearings.  I think that to the left leads back towards the house but these woods are like a maze, especially at night.  Maybe if I head down to the right I'll intersect a road, but would that do me any good? This far in the middle of nowhere it can be miles between roads and at this time of night I doubt anyone with good intentions would be out driving.\\nLeft and up I guess it's going to be.  Just as I start to take a few steps a snap of a branch  in that direction freezes me in my tracks.  I realize that it's the first noise I'd heard since diving into the pines. The woods should have sound, right?  It's a cold winter's night but there are still plenty of things that aren't hibernating.  I should be able to hear deer shuffling, or squirrels in the trees, or possibly a raccoon coming out to see what the hell I'm doing up at this hour.\\nIt's so unfair.  Humans aren't meant to be in situations like this.  Our senses are so weak compared to most other animals, and especially at night we're at our most vulnerable.  I want to hear some well-adapted forest creature tell me it's okay.  Tell me that there's nothing around for either of us to be afraid of.\\nInstead, there's absolute silence.  That means he's out here, doesn't it?  I know it.  It's through a pure, instinctual certainty that I just know that he's somewhere close by.\\nI crouch down and start to crawl back to the shadows under the pine trees.

Snow and dirt showers down, choking me, and for a moment I wonder if he didn't miss on purpose. \\n I leap forward, belly flopping into an unexpectedly deep drift before catching my balance and taking off on the run again down the hill.

I move forward as quickly as I feel confident in, listening for any sounds either from below or behind me.  \\nIn the beginning I would sweep my feet ahead of me first, clearing away the top layer so I could see if the ice was shallower.  I quickly give up on that though because everything is a uniform black under me and I really should have found a walking stick or something like that.  Bear Grylls always said to have something with you that you can use to brace yourself with if you start to go under.  Too late to go back for it now, sorry Bear.\\nI'm about halfway across when there's a loud \u201cpop!\u201d and I feel a fracture run straight under my feet.  I quickly step backwards and there's another sequence of cracks spreading around me like a spider web.  Ohshitshitshit!\\nI stop moving and freeze, arms out and caught mid-step in an awkward dancers pose.  Another crack and the ice in front of me starts to slump.\\n\u201cRun!\u201d A voice shouts from behind me.  I squeeze my eyes shut before forcing myself to glance back.  The Younger Man is standing at the edge of the lake, rifle in one hand and gesturing to me with the other.\\n\u201cThe ice is too shallow!  Come back here!\u201d  He reaches out towards me like he expects me to run back and grab it.  Is he for real?\\n\u201cFuck you!\u201d  I shout.  It comes out as a panicked squeak and I bolt forward, running toward the shore 30 meters ahead.  \\nImmediately the ice begins to collapse under me, the greater impact of my steps fully breaking the fractures.  I hear Bear's voice in my head shouting to never move quickly on ice but I see the Younger Man out of the corner of my eye.  He's running to the side, trying to circle around and intercept me before I get to the shore. It makes me run all the harder, my feet rolling out from under me like I'm running across a pile of logs.  He shouts something at me again and my foot breaks through the ice and I trip, landing on my hands and knees.\\n\u201cShit!\u201d He turns and runs directly towards me and in that moment the ice breaks and I go under.\\nHoly shit it's cold!  It comes as such a shock I almost loose consciousness.  My lungs fill with the icy water and for a second I can only think that this is what drowning feels like.  I start kicking and thrashing wildly but I can't find the hole I just fell through.  Above my head is solid ice and I punch and claw at it.  With the snow on top it's close to pitch black under here.  I know I should try to stay calm but I'm about to fucking die and I'm scrabbling and scrabbling and my lungs are burning and-\\nFingers tangle in my hair and jerk me upwards, yanking on my scalp painfully.  I don't fight it though, I couldn't even if I tried.  I'm so cold I'm only vaguely aware of being body-slammed onto the rocks.  I can taste blood but all I can do is lie there on my stomach and cough, curling up into a little ball.  I claw my fingers into the ground as my body tries to hack up all the water it breathed in.  It burns my nose and eyes and I feel a hand crush my arm, shaking roughly me and trying to drag me to my feet.\\n\u201cGet up!\u201d the Younger Man yells at me, practically jerking my arm out of its socket.  He's dripping wet also.  He must have also fallen in when he went after me.\\n\u201cFuck you,\u201d I manage to wheeze and my legs collapse underneath me.  He mutters something and kicks me in the stomach which ironically helps to get more of the water out of my lungs.\\n\u201cWhat...the fuck... do you want?\u201d I hisses through clenched teeth, squeezing my eyes tightly closed.  I don't need to see him.  I don't want to.  Just fucking kill me or leave me the fuck alone!\\n\u201cGoddamn I wish I could kill you\u201d he growls, as if reading my thoughts. He grabs a fistfull of my hair again and start to drag me by it.  I try to kick out but I'm to weak to do anything other than claw at his arm.\\n\u201cLet me the fuck go-\u201d I start to say, trying to get my feet under me.  Before I can continue he drops me suddenly and the last thing I see is the butt of his rifle swinging toward my face yet again.  At least it's on a different side than last time.  \\nThen everything goes black.\\n\\n<<set $wentLake = \"true\">>\\n\\n[[Continue.|S4_P0]]\\n\\n/% \\tCONT -> S4_P1\\t %/\\n\\n/%  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %/",

I wouldn't call it an actual sleep, but more of taking a quiet moment with my eyes closed before I revive and have to start fighting again. For a few minutes I just let myself float, teetering on the edge of consciousness, and let my aching and bruised muscles melt the ground under me.\\nFinally my breathing and heart rate return to normal and I crack my eyes open.  Something is wrong.  It's not just that I'm lying down in bare snow and probably borderline hypothermic, but now I'm hearing in the distance a hum. Similar to the hum I heard earlier from the basement, but this time it's moving and fading in and out as it bounces around the trees.  I push myself up onto my elbows and listen closer.\\nAn engine.  A loud engine that's in the distance but moving towards me.  A loud engine like the truck our kidnappers had.\\n\u201cOh fuck my life...\u201d I whine softly, wadding up a handful of snow and toss it to the sky, directing it to whatever god I don't believe in that I must have so savagely pissed off to deserve a night like tonight.\\nI crawl to my knees but it takes a little longer to come fully up onto my feet.  \\nI lean heavily against my rescue-tree for support and look around my new area.  More of the same: tall pine trees and deep shadows. \\nThe rumbling hum grows louder.  Yeah yeah, I'm moving.  \\nThe avalanche slope is behind me, the noise is coming from the right, fuck-knows-what is to the left, so I go straight.  Why?  Why not.   I'm so over this nature shit.  If I somehow survive this I'm never leaving the city ever again.  \\nAt first I halfheartedly try to disguise my footprints but give up because it's a losing battle when every other step is a post hole.  The engine noise follows me for a while before coming to a stop and I assume that my hunter must have driven to the edge of the avalanche and is either searching for me buried in all the debris or is following my obvious trail.\\nAnother meter slog and the forest ends again, this time at a frozen over lake instead of a cliff edge.  The lake is long but narrow and it's probably not more than 100-150 meters to the far shore.  Beyond it from this angle I can see a bright strip of white cutting through the trees and running up and over a low hill.  A road?  \\nI take a cautious step out onto the ice.  A little cracking but it holds and I know that the edges of a lake are the thinnest.  Going straight across is going to be the shortest route to the other side, but I'd have to cross out in the open.  \\nI glance around the shoreline for alternatives.  The sound was coming from the right so I can't go that way.  To the left the lake bends and continues out of sight but the edges are rimmed with dormant cattails and grass and shouldn't be too difficult to walk through.\\n\\n\\n\\n[[Cross the lake and go to the road.|S3_P25]]\\n[[Go to the left and follow the shore.|S3_P26]]\\n\\n/% \\tCHOICE\\n1) Cross the lake and go to the road. ->S3_P25\\n2) Go to the left and follow the shore. ->S3_P26\\n\\t %/\\n\\n/%  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %/",

The Younger Man watches me from a distance but he seems hesitant to come any closer.  Somehow I doubt it's because he's afraid of a little blood.\\nMore than a little blood as it turns out.  When I start to pull off the blanket the Older Man groans very faintly under his faltering breath and the fabric peels back wetly.\\nHe has some sort of wound on his neck that I'll assess later, but it's the gaping hole in his side abdomen that's brought him this close to death.  He's clearly been impaled by something and it would take a significant amount of force to go all the way through him like this.\\nIf he's this badly off I can't help but wonder what condition Aria must be in.  If she's even still alive... The Younger Man refuses to let me see her but somehow, deep in my heart, our sisterly psychic connection is telling me not to give up on her just yet.\\nI shake my head, clearing my thoughts and focusing back on the task at hand.  Whatever struck him must have missed the most critical organs or he'd be dead by now.  However, the bleeding is still very heavy and there are limits to what I can do for him.  Maybe the Younger Man will listen to reason and let us go so he can take him to the hospital?  Yeah, unlikely.

A slushy scraping noise followed a second later by another one.  \\nWhat in the hell?\\n\u201cWhat did he get hit by?\u201d I ask the Younger Man, hoping that he didn't hear anything. I squint at the wound, contemplating the distinctly square shape to the edges.  It's so dark in here with only that one candle I can barely see. I look over my shoulder at the him and he shifts his feet uncomfortably, keeping his distance.\\n\u201cPiece of railing,\u201d he says flatly, keeping his eyes on the floor.\\nRailing?  Okay... So, he somehow fell out of the attic window and landed on the railing on the front porch.

So instead I'm going to try a more subtle approach to distracting him. \\n\u201cCan you take this thing off me?\u201d I try to ask from under the tape over my mouth.  It comes out as an unintelligible mumble.  The Younger Man gives me a sidelong glare before turning his attention back to the road and shaking his head.  \\n\u201cI want to talk.  Take this off me.\u201d  I try again, trying to push the tape off with my tongue.  Mumble mumble but it works this time.  He reaches over and grabs the edge of the tape.  \u201cYou start screaming and I'm going to hit you,\u201d he warns.  I shrug and nod.  Yeah, and as soon as I get the chance I'm stabbing you with something and taking your car, asshole, so let's call it even for now.\\nHe yanks the tape off without any concern to the layers off skin from my lips he takes along with it.  \\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d he snaps, eyes focused on the road and his free hand resting on the trigger of the rifle.\\n\u201cYour check engine light's on,\u201d I say, my voice cracking slightly.

It's streaked with mold and the occasional drips of water splash onto the floor. \\n\\n\\n\\n[[Investigate the arm chair in the corner to the left.|S2_P4]]\\n[[See what's off to the right.|S2_P11]]\\n[[Investigate the wooden chair behind you.|S2_P12]]\\n[[Go forward to the railing going up.|S2-P13]]\\n[[Investigate the ceiling.|S2-P14]]\\n\\n/% \\tCHOICE\\n1) Investigate the arm chair in the corner to the left. ->S2_P4\\n2) See what's off to the right. ->S2_P11\\n3)  Investigate the wooden chair behind you. ->S2_P12\\n4) Go forward to the railing going up. ->S2-P13\\n5) Investigate the ceiling. ->S2-P14\\n\\t %/\\n\\n/%  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %/",

Once we reach it the tall pine trees should block out the any of the light remaining from the late evening  and then we can find a place to hide.  \\nI hear the man mutter \u201cfuck\u201d under his breath but I don't turn around.  We're almost there, so close.  But right by the edge of the parking lot the forest starts with a thick and nearly impassible wall of thorns and brush.  We try to press through it quickly but it's so dense that it's difficult to see anything and Aria keeps slipping in those fucking boots of hers.  I swear I'm going to burn those things as soon as I get the chance.\\nWe don't even see the knee high ditch before we fall into it.  Just as we're scrambling out of it, dragging ourselves up with the help of an adolescent ponderosa pine, a bright suddenly light falls on us.  Shielding my eyes from the blinding light with my hand, I see the silhouette of a man partially slumped over.  He's carrying something very heavy over his shoulders and the hunting rifle's illuminated in his free hand.\\n\u201cNeed some help, ladies?\u201d he chuckles and unceremoniously drops his burden to the ground.   \\nAria and I both scream in unison and lunge backwards, so desperate in our panic that we get tangled in each other's legs and fall right back into the ditch we'd just climbed out of.\\nThe man's laugh echoes against the trees as he stalks toward us.  \u201cDad!

The newcomer's between us and our car, but maybe we can take him?  Just knock him down quickly before the other man can shoot us?\\nBehind him in the distance a glint of light flashes and catches my eye.

We don't have any need for them right now, but I place them on top just in case.\\n\u201cWhy are you-\u201d Aria starts to ask, but I shrug and dig deeper.  \\nUnderneath the clothes are some random odds and ends: hairbrush, books, coffee cup, and house shoes.

That's a good sign.\\nI look over at Aria and give her an up and down inspection. Her face is covered in bruises and scratches and she has that wound on her leg but she doesn't seem in desperate need of help.  I notice that she's wearing a torn black wool coat that I'd never seen before.  Some other time I'm going to ask her what happened in here but for right now I don't think either of us are quite up to that particular conversation.\\nWe get up and walk a little further.  I break off a pine branch for Aria to use as a walking stick and pull out the cellphone I'd stolen earlier.  It takes a few more minutes before we get to a more open area of the trees where we can get reception.\\nI dial 911 and start laughing.  \u201cThey've put me on hold,\u201d I tell Aria and she shakes her head at me in disbelief.  \\n\u201cGood thing we're not in an emergency or anything like that,\u201d she mutters.\\nFor some reason that comment strikes me as unbelievably funny.

It hits with an impact that reverberates up along my arm but I'm so frantic I barely even notice it.  \\nHe falls onto his knees on the floor but he still tries to reach for me.  Aria jumps forward and strikes him one last time with the rifle and he finally collapses and goes still.\\nFor a moment all I can hear is my own breathing.  In the dim light I can see Aria hovered over him, rifle drawn back and ready in case he somehow springs back to consciousness.\\n\u201cAria?\u201d I call out to her breathlessly.  \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\\nShe looks at me and for a moment I barely even recognize her.  Then she runs to me and crushes me in a bear-hug, squeezing so so tightly my already bruised ribs feel like hot coals.  I bury one of my hands into her hair and use the other to pat her down, feeling for injuries.  \\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask again and she slowly unlatches herself from me.\\n\u201cY-yeah.\u201d  Her voice is strung tight and it's not very convincing but I know what she means. \\nI take a step towards the Younger Man and she catches my hand, trying to drag me back.\\n\u201cI need to check his pulse,\u201d I tell her, pulling her with me.  She reluctantly nods and picks up the rifle from where she'd dropped it..\\nIt takes me a moment in the near darkness to find the main artery in his neck, but his breathing and pulse are both steady.  I breath a shaky sigh of relief.  We didn't kill him.  He's just unconscious.\\nI pull the car keys out of his vest and shove them into my front pocket. \\n\u201cOpen the front door,\u201d I tell Aria.  \u201cWe need more light.\u201d\\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asks, voice skeptical.\\n\u201cWe have to tie him up.  We're going to drive out of here and call the cops but we need to secure him first.\u201d\\nI step away from him and look around, trying to remember where there's any rope or... Well, there must be some duct tape somewhere.  Back in the truck?\\nI come up to standing and the room fills with bright light as Aria opens the door.  The Younger Man has several wounds on his temples but nothing that he'll immediately die from.  I can't bring myself to look at the Older Man quite yet.  Even if we were to call an ambulance now it would be too late for them to do anything for him.\\n\u201cHow about downstairs?\u201d Aria says, coming to my side.  \\nOh, she wants us to lock the Younger Man up in the basement.  Yes, that idea appeals to me very much.\\nI grab one of his ankles and Aria grabs the other and we slowly drag him out of the room and into that dark hallway I'd run out of when I first escaped without her.  Some other time I'm going to ask her what happened in here but for right now I don't think either of us are quite up to that particular conversation.\\nI throw open the hatch and we roll him in over and inside, letting him tumble down the steps like he's a roll of carpeting.  Sure, we could have handled him more carefully but... I didn't want to.  \\nI close the hatch and slide the fire poker through the two loops on it and the floor.  That should be enough to keep him in there.\\nHolding Aria's hand I lead us both out of the hallway and towards the front door.\\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Aria asks, referring to the unmoving shape lying on the sofa.\\n\u201cHe... he's dead.\u201d \\nThe two words hang between us and I tug on her, trying to prompt her to move and get out of here.  She pauses and stares at the couch and I can't see her expression with her back to the light from the door.\\n\u201cGood.\u201d She finally says and pushes past me.\\nWhen we step outside onto the front porch it's already well into dawn and the rising sun glares into my eyes.  I realize now that Aria's limping and her face is covered in bruises and scratches.  She's wearing a torn black wool coat that I'd never seen before.  I frown at it and I have to ask her one question before we can leave.\\n\u201cAria?\u201d My voice wavers. \u201cBack there, when I was gone. Um...\u201d I don't know exactly how to phrase this.  \u201cDid he... did he do anything to you?\u201d\\nShe pauses and blinks at me a few times before she interprets through my sister-speak what I'm really asking.\\n\u201cNo.  God no.\u201d She shakes her head.  \u201cIt wasn't... I mean when I escaped he tried to kill me but... It wasn't like that.\u201d  \\nI exhale a breath I hadn't even realized I was holding.  \u201cSo you're okay?\u201d\\nShe offers me a weak smile.  \u201cNot really.  But we're both still alive and that's what matters, right?\u201d\\nYeah, it is.\\n\u201cI'll drive,\u201d I tell her, opening the door to the truck and sliding in behind the wheel.  She/Aria shuffles over to the other side and I put the truck into drive and start slowly working our way down the icy road.  Fine is the definitely wrong word.  But we're both alive and we're both getting out of here.

I just can't.\\nShe pauses a second before figuring out what I mean and going back into the room.  As soon as she leaves I rush out of the doorway and lean over the broken railing of the porch, puking out the tiny contents of my stomach followed by a painful and caustic steam of bile.  I shakily go down the steps and crouch in the snow, continuously scrubbing handfuls of it into my face and mouth until it stops coming back pink.\\n\u201cKat?\u201d \\nI look over my shoulder and Aria's watching me from the porch.  \u201cI think I'd better drive,\u201d she says, coming over to me and helping me up to my feet.\\nI realize now that she's limping and her face is covered in bruises and scratches.  She's wearing a torn black wool coat that I'd never seen before.\\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d It's now my turn to ask her.  I tuck my hand under her armpit and help her take  the weight off her hurt leg.  She gives me a sidelong stare and struggles to find the right words.  \\n\u201cI'll live,\u201d she eventually settles on.  \\nWe get to the car and I take the keys from her.  She's about to object but I've already got the door open and am sliding into the drivers seat.  \u201cIt's fine,\u201d I tell her.  \u201cI'm fine.  Don't worry.  Let's just get out of here.\u201d\\nShe shuffles over to the other side and I put the truck into drive and start slowly working our way down the icy road.  Fine is the definitely wrong word.  But we're both alive and we're both getting out of here.

He tries to shout something at me and it comes out as a choked garble.  \\n\u201cMove!\u201d Aria screams again and I shove my knee into his kidneys, knocking him back onto his knees when he starts to rise.  How the hell can he still be so strong?!\\nSuddenly he changes strategy and falls back against me, knocking us both onto our backs.  He spins around and straddles me, grip closing relentlessly around my throat.  Bright stars fill the dark room and I claw and kick at him.  He'd almost been choked out for Christ's sake, I should be able to overpower him! I should be able to-\\nA deafening crack and he partially collapses on top of me.  I try to shove him off and his fingers squeeze around my wrist, still trying to subdue me.  \\nAnother crack and he falls to the side and I realize Aria's hitting him with the stock of the rifle.  It seems only fitting after he's done that so many times to me...\\nHe slumps off of me and tries to get back to his feet, leaning heavily on the couch next to us.  My fingers close around the fire poker I'd dropped and I swing it almost blindly.  It hits with an impact that reverberates up along my arm but I'm so frantic I barely even notice it.  \\nHe falls onto his knees on the floor but he still tries to reach for me.  Aria jumps forward and strikes him one last time with the rifle and he finally collapses and goes still.\\nFor a moment all I can hear is my own breathing.  In the dim light I can see Aria hovered over him, rifle drawn back and ready in case he somehow springs back to consciousness.\\n\u201cAria?\u201d I call out to her breathlessly.  \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\\nShe looks at me and for a moment I barely even recognize her.  Then she runs to me and crushes me in a bear-hug, squeezing so tightly my already bruised ribs feel like hot coals.  I bury one of my hands into her hair and use the other to pat her down, feeling for injuries.  \\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask again and she slowly unlatches herself from me.\\n\u201cY-yeah.\u201d  Her voice is strung tight and it's not very convincing but I know what she means.  \\nI take a step towards the Younger Man and she catches my hand, trying to drag me back.\\n\u201cI need to check his pulse,\u201d I tell her, pulling her with me.  She reluctantly nods and picks up the rifle from where she'd dropped it.\\nIt takes me a moment in the near darkness to find the main artery in his neck, but his breathing and pulse are both steady.  I breath a shaky sigh of relief.  We didn't kill him.  He's just unconscious.\\nI pull the car keys out of his vest and shove them into my front pocket. \\n\u201cOpen the front door,\u201d I tell Aria.  \u201cWe need more light.\u201d\\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she says, voice skeptical.\\n\u201cWe have to tie him up.  We're going to drive out of here and call the cops but we need to secure him first.\u201d\\nI step away from him and look around, trying to remember where there's any rope or... Well, there must be some duct tape somewhere.  Possibly back in the truck?\\nI come up to standing and the room fills with bright light as Aria opens the door.  The Younger Man has several wounds on his temples but nothing that he'll immediately die from. I look over the couch at the Older Man.  I sure as hell am not taking him with us so he'll have to hang on his own until the police send an ambulance up here to get him.\\n\u201cHow about downstairs?\u201d Aria says, coming to my side.  \\nOh, she wants us to lock them up in the basement.  Yes, that idea appeals to me very much.\\nWe start with the Younger Man.  I grab one of his ankles and Aria grabs the other and we slowly drag him out of the room and into that dark hallway I'd run out of when I first escaped without her.  Some other time I'm going to ask her what happened in here but for right now I don't think either of us are quite up to that particular conversation.\\nI throw open the hatch and we roll him in over and inside, letting him tumble down the steps like he's a roll of carpeting.  Sure, we could have handled him  more carefully but... I didn't want to.  \\nWe handle the limp body of the Older Man slightly more gingerly.  He's lighter and easier to move and when we send him sliding down the steps his Son is conveniently already lying there to soften to landing.\\nI close the hatch and slide the fire poker through the two loops on it and the floor.  That should be enough to keep them in there.\\nHolding Aria's hand I lead us both out of the hallway and towards the front door.  When we step outside onto the front porch it's already well into dawn and the rising sun glares into my eyes.  I realize now that Aria's limping and her face is covered in bruises and scratches.  She's wearing a torn black wool coat that I'd never seen before.  I frown at it and I have to ask her one question before we can leave.\\n\u201cAria?\u201d My voice wavers. \u201cBack there, when I was gone. Um...\u201d I don't know exactly how to phrase this.  \u201cDid he... did he do anything to you?\u201d\\nShe pauses and blinks at me a few times before she interprets through my sister-speak what I'm really asking.\\n\u201cNo.  God no.\u201d She shakes her head.  \u201cIt wasn't... I mean when I escaped he tried to kill me but... It wasn't like that.\u201d  \\nI exhale a breath I hadn't even realized I was holding.  \u201cSo you're okay?\u201d\\nShe offers me a weak smile.  \u201cNot really.  But we're both still alive and that's what matters, right?\u201d\\nYeah, it is.\\n\u201cI'll drive,\u201d I tell her, opening the door to the truck and sliding in behind the wheel.  She/Aria shuffles over to the other side and I put the truck into drive and start slowly working our way down the icy road.  Fine is the definitely wrong word.

When we get far enough away from the house we stop to catch our breath and listen.\\nNothing.  Just the birds in the trees.  That's a good sign.\\nI look over at Aria and give her an up and down inspection. Her face is covered in bruises and scratches and she has that wound on her leg but she doesn't seem in desperate need of help.  I notice that she's wearing a torn black wool coat that I'd never seen before.  Some other time I'm going to ask her what happened in here but for right now I don't think either of us are quite up to that particular conversation.\\nWe get up and walk a little further and I break off a pine branch for Aria to use as a walking stick.  After a few more minutes the forest opens up to a clearing which leads to a slope heading steeply down into a valley.  At the far end of the valley, around three or so miles ahead of us, is the black curving line of a paved road.\\n\u201cThat's our way out of here,\u201d I tell Aria.  \u201cYou up to it?\u201d \\nShe gives me a faint smile.  \u201cAre there any other options?\u201d\\nI shake my head.  If I'd managed to get the cellphone earlier maybe I could have called for help.  But we don't have it so I guess we've got to walk out of here the hard way.  No big deal, really.  We've survived everything else this night had thrown our way, so I guess that a bit of waiting isn't going to hurt us.

A part of me is terrified, and another part is slightly guilty that we didn't do anything for whoever that was back there.  Maybe he or she was still alive and we could have overpowered the man and... and what?  We'd drag the body back through the snow?

He's dressed all in black and his arms are crossed over his chest with his head is bowed low, a black cowboy hat covering his face.  In the dim of twilight he almost looks like one of those strange cowboy cutout silhouettes people put in their front yards.  There's a dark colored pickup truck parked behind him that wasn't there when we first pulled in.  \\n\u201cKat?\u201d Aria's whisper is barely audible.  I don't know if he's seen us yet but we weren't exactly being quiet as we came charging out of the clearing and running through the crunchy gravel of the parking lot. \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d\\n\u201cShhh...\u201d I quiet her immediately.  The man hasn't moved at all and neither have we.  I risk a glance back behind into the woods.  The edge of the forest is nearly impassable with thick underbrush; we'd have to go back on the main trail we for a little bit before we could get into the more open forest.  \\nAnd what would we do next?  Find some place to hide until morning?  It's getting numbingly cold already and that other man is still out there somewhere. \\nHowever, there's also the main highway as an option.  It's only a short ways uphill from this parking lot, around 150 feet give or take.  If any other cars pass by we can try to flag them down.\\nA click sound comes from by the car and Aria's shoulders jump.  The man leaning there has lit a cigarette and I can see his face briefly in the flash of the lighter.  I'd guess he's somewhere in his 60s if not older.  A long gray beard runs part way down his chest and he's staring at the ground in front of him.  I shift my gaze down and both our purses are lying on the ground by his feet.  I'd hidden them in the trunk before we'd left for our walk this afternoon. \\nI suddenly notice that glass of the front drivers side window's been smashed in and is littering the ground like confetti.

Pretty soon the truck reaches the top of the long mountain that we'd been driving up and slows as we pull into the driveway of the house.  Dawn has progressed a little more by now and I get my first real view of what the building actually looks like:  it's a large 3-story log cabin that probably used to be a quite nice summer home in the past.  Now though all the windows on the 1st and 2nd floors have been boarded up and the  balcony on the 3rd story has collapsed.\\nWait-  I don't think it was like this before when I first ran outside.  The balcony wraps around the whole house and when I'd left at least the section at the back had been intact.\\nSo I guess this must have happened after I got separated from Aria?  Was this why the Younger Man had ran off when he'd gotten that phone call?\\n\\n\\n\\n[[Continue.|S4-P13]]\\n\\n/% \\tCONT -> S4-P13\\t %/\\n\\n/%  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %/",

His arms are crossed tightly over his chest and he seems highly defensive.\\n\u201cYou did it?\u201d I ask incredulously.  \u201cYou just pulled it out of him?  You didn't think it would be better to leave it in?\u201d  Seriously?  That's like First Aid 101: leave the cork in the bottle.\\n\u201cWhat was I supposed to do?\u201d he snaps, his mood suddenly changing from petulant to angry. \u201cI had to bring him in.\u201d\\n\u201cYou could have taken him to a hospital.  He's lost so much blood by now that I all I can do is stabilize him.  He'll need a transfusion and surgery and-\u201d\\n\u201cSo you can't fix him?\u201d he interrupts again, staring blackly at his partner.  His fingers tighten their grip on the rifle.\\nWhat the hell does he expect from me?  I'm just a medical student armed with a glorified first aid kit.  \u201cNo, I can't  exactly \u201cfix\u201d him\u201d, I say, choosing my words carefully.  I need to keep myself useful and not antagonize him too much.  \u201cBut I can help him.  I can slow down the bleeding enough that he can be moved.  Then you really have to take him to a hospital.  You can drop him off anonymously at the emergency room and-\u201d\\n\u201cFine,\u201d he says quickly, taking his first step closer to us.  \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d\\nWell shit, that's one hell of a deep question to ask me right now.  What I really need is to find a way to either convince him to let us go or distract him and make a run for it.  First off though if I'm going to do this operation I'll need some better equipment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<<if $sawBullets eq \"true\">>\\n[[Ask him to bring more supplies.|S4_P22]]\\n<<else>>\\n[[Ask him to bring more supplies. |S4_P21]]\\n<<endif>>\\n[[Ask him to turn on the lights.|S4_P23]]\\n\\n/% \\tCHOICE\\n1) Ask him to bring more supplies. ->S4-P21 OR S4_P22\\n2) Ask him to turn on the lights. ->S4_P23\\n\\t %/\\n\\n/%  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ %/  \\n\\n\\n",
