How would this goblin respond if you chose one option--and how would the same goblin react differently if you chose another option.\n\nI don't know how many times you have played through (maybe you stumbled here on your first try--wow, that makes this message so awkward). \n\nBut this story is NOT consistent.\n\nIt seems like consistency would have been a good design choice because it would have meant that the player could learn from feedback. You could learn what the goblin was like and start predicting his reactions on subsequent playthroughs--like learning the patterns of mini-bosses in an action game. You would then take some pleasure in predicting responses and seeing them come true.\n\nThere would be a moment where you would feel like you had predicted what I had written. There would be a moment where we might have some connection.\n\nBut that's not how this Twine works.\n\nI wanted you to feel unsettled.\n\nI wanted you to feel like it was unfair.\n\nI wanted you to feel like you couldn't catch a break no matter what you did.\n\nI wanted you to feel like even your victories were hollow. Too easily gotten, or too dependent on dumb luck for you to take any credit for them.\n\nWas that too frustrating? Was it too cruel of me? Does it deprive the Twine of its entertainment value?\n\nAnd does this apology become just some artistic excuse to airbrush out my flawed design? \n\nAm I trying to tell you: \"It's okay that this is a poorly-written story. It's okay, because I know that. It's intentionally bad. And that's what makes it art.\"\n\nBad design is still bad design. Even if it's bad by design.\n\nMaybe I was just too lazy to go back and revise all of the goblin's responses once I started experimenting with this Twine. Maybe I'm too sloppy. Maybe I got tired of working on this after pouring hours into it. Maybe I got too eager for someone else to look at it.\n\nShould I have fleshed out the player character more, or is it better to leave the player character an empty vessel for you to pour yourself into?\n\nMaybe some of the metafiction was too much. Did you think it was too much?\n\nSome of it hits pretty close to home for me. But nobody wants to read that stuff. \n\nIt's like I tricked you into reading my diary. \n\nHow ego-centric is that?\n\nHow ego-centric is this little apology?\n\nIt's like some kind of DVD commentary that just drones on and on.\n\nIt's time to wrap this up.\n\nBut, one more thing.\n\nJust so you know, half of the pleasure for me has been in imagining the game itself...the scenes, the dialogues, the jokes...\n\nThe other half of the pleasure has been in imagining you sitting there, reading this, right now, and scratching your head, saying, \"What the hell was that?\"\n\n\n\nOkay, that's enough from me. I'll shut up.\n\nThis is really...\n\n\n[[The End.]]",
