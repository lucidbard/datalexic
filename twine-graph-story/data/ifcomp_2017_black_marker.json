      "text": "**The JFK Incident: A Case Study**\n**Declassification date: Jan 19 2047**\n<span class=\"censored\">On the 3rd of November 2016, CONDOR detected a series of encrypted messages coming from a device which had previously only sent unencrypted ones.  This was ignored initially -- most Agency staff use encrypted messages as a matter of course -- but was treated with more interest when a second CONDOR report mentioned the same device in connection with searches such as \"guns\" and \"bombs\" |Koran>[along with the purchase of a copy of the Koran].  Police were informed, but decided not to intervene immediately, and a remote hack was authorised.  Surprisingly, the data gathered seemed to imply that the suspect had recently become interested, for no apparent reason, in munitions |Koran>[and Islam].\nExactly one month later, the suspect purchased an assault weapon, a bulletproof vest, and several boxes of ammunition.  |Credit>[The CONDOR team had recently added the ability to decrypt and analyse credit card purchases without the knowledge of shoppers or banks].  CONDOR combined this with previous knowledge and re-flagged the suspect.  Police once again declined to investigate.\nOn the 7th of January 2017, the suspect entered JFK International Airport, NY.  CONDOR had noted erratic behaviour in the previous week.  The repeat flaggings served as enough evidence that the police force decided, at last, to surveil the suspect themselves.  |Cameras>[Once within JFK, his face was detected by automatic facial-recognition cameras].  Airport police were placed on high alert and succeeded in disarming the suspect before he was able to kill or injure anyone.\nThis is only one example of the success of CONDOR.  We suggest that the Agency wasted both money and time by not acting more decisively and quickly.  As CONDOR's algorithms become more sophisticated, they should be trusted more readily.  Equally, CONDOR succeeded here due to the vast amounts of data to which it had access.  More data, |Extralegal>[legally obtained or not], could well further increase its efficiency.  We note in conclusion that the overwhelming number of occurrences such as this completely invalidate Krull's argument, which still has its adherents almost ten years on.</span>\n*Recommendation:* Censor carefully.

He quickly became instrumental in the development of the CONDOR system, designing many of the algorithms used to rank possible deviations from the norm by threat level.  Before 2009, there was no reason to believe that he was anything other than a loyal and highly competent Agency member.\nIn early 2009, Krull began to express doubts about CONDOR.  Specifically, he objected to what he termed \"a needless invasion of privacy\".  |Feelings>[Feelings of this sort are not unusual amongst junior Agency staff, but their presence in a senior technician who had seen firsthand the effectiveness of the Agency's methods was surprising].\nKrull made numerous requests to those leading the CONDOR project, suggesting safeguards for the data collected.  |Impractical>[Much of what he came up with would have made CONDOR unuseable].  He began to create obstructions to the project, refusing to do any more work until his doubts were satisfied.  As he was by this time a fairly senior member of the CONDOR design group, this represented a major blockage.\nHe was threatened with immediate termination and began to work again the next day.  A week later, however, WikiLeaks recieved most of the documents he had written during his time at the Agency.  These detailed the methods used by CONDOR, |Illegal>[as well as the breaches of constitutional and case law that CONDOR represents].  This release set back the development and deployment of CONDOR by several years, |Dangerous>[during which time we estimate that twenty people died and twenty-four were seriously injured by threats about which CONDOR could have warned the Agency in advance].\nKrull's conduct was unacceptable, and he was dismisssed instantly.  Attempts to prosecute stalled because he went off-grid and has not been heard of since.</span>\n*Recommendation:* This was a high-profile case, so there is no need to censor Krull's name.

There are four different endings, of which two may reasonably be counted as win states; if you're having trouble finding them, try being more or less radical at various points.\n\nI've tried to portray censorship in an ambiguous, if not positive, light.  I would agree that it is often a danger and that citizens in general should know more about the workings of their governments than they do, but full transparency would ruin a state.  Winning wars is impossible if the enemy can file a Freedom of Information Act request for your latest tactics.\n\nHalfway through the development process, I became aware of Blackbar, another game about censorship.  It's essentially Black Marker from the point of view of everyone who's actually reading these censored documents.\n\nThanks to my beta testers.  Thanks to Jason McIntosh for organising the IFComp, and to the Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation for running it.  Thanks to my family for being tolerant while I put this together.  Finally, thanks to the excellent people who made Twine and, in particular, Harlowe.  Outside of &ldquo;Beginning Twine&rdquo; tutorials, I haven't heard loads about Twine file formats.  I found Harlowe a joy to work in and I'm very grateful to Leon Arnott.\n\n[[Back|Epigraph]]",
