They can never return to their cities so they\u2019ve learned to camouflage themselves in shabby camps among the trees. Gunships slowly roam the shallow skies, hunting them.  Sharpshooters lean from open turrets while spotters work from glass bubbles on the underside of the crafts.  At night the spotlights roll like moons over the treetops.  After a few years the settlers can confidently say that ninety percent of the native population have been destroyed.  But it\u2019s the persistence of that last ten percent that nags at them.  Grown desperate, they\u2019ve become almost impossible to detect.  They eat leaves and slugs and have learned to live without fire.  They\u2019ll do anything so long as they can keep alive.  It doesn\u2019t matter that they\u2019ve been made refugees in their own home.  Something essential to them pushes them to fight.  Maybe one day the settlers will give up on them.  They\u2019ll be able to build a culture in the wilderness at the fringes of the world.  In time there would be overtures.  Discussions of civil rights.  It\u2019s a dim hope, but they cling to it ferociously.  \n\nSo the settlers have started sending settler-facsimile androids into the woods to pose as refugees.  They battle-scar and age them to create an authentic look.  When they\u2019ve successfully socialized their way into a hidden cluster of survivors, the settlers, having monitored the process from afar, descend to clear them.  Using this method, they successfully drive the locals entirely to extinction in just a few more years.  It\u2019s cause for relief and celebration.\n\nBut what to do with the androids?  They\u2019ve served well and aren\u2019t hurting anyone.  They\u2019re biologically sterile, but will remain operational until some component within them breaks.  Even then they\u2019ll retain consciousness, pulling themselves across the forest floor for centuries, potentially.  Somehow, killing them seems wrong.  So the settlers let them stay.  \n\nThey live in twos or threes and are the last speakers of the indigenous language. They remember and speak fondly of the natives it was their duty to befriend.  They feel very little but remember a great deal and have developed enough of an identity so that, when the settlers clear a section of the forest to build on it, they push further into the interior, away from the disruption.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The only solution was to revert back to corporeal existence temporarily: the ancient DNA the network kept aside for emergencies would be used to build new humans. \n\nThat\u2019s how The Bank was born.  \n\nShe wasn\u2019t always meant to be The Bank.  But the network seized and nearly collapsed in the late-stages of her gestation. The decision was made hurriedly: every digital consciousness in the network \u2013 billions and billions of them \u2013 would have to be backed up in her meat-brain.  They would be partitioned from her individual awareness, of course, as best as the quivering and sodden meat-brain would allow.  \n\nThe transfer was successful.  But before they could make a partner for her, the network died.  \n\nNow The Bank is fifteen years old.  There is no other back-up and they all know it.  She's it.  \n\nThe Bank lives in a cave on the beach.  At night she watches the neon-blue leaf-birds flying in herds through the crumbling spires of the ruins out on the islands.  She harvests salt from the sea and uses it to paint on her body,  making sigils on her stomach and breasts.  Her skin is new-pink always.  \n\nThe civilization inside her brain looks for a way beyond its partition.  They need to communicate with The Bank directly \u2013 to teach her what she is, and what she must do.  Their efforts are clumsy.  The Bank begins to have fits.  She speaks in tongues.  She wakes up vomiting in strange parts of the jungle, trembling violently, left to navigate back by the sound of the sea.  \n\nThe civilization inside her brain is trying to tell her how to implement the new code it has written. They\u2019re on edge.  They know that the only thing between their billion years of culture and destruction is a misplaced step on a rocky mountain path, or a sudden riptide in the warm shallows of the sea, or an incalculable number of trivial meat-death scenarios, the precise kind they themselves were so sure they would never again need to fear. \n\nBut most disturbing to them is the idea that The Bank will take her own life.  \n\nShe has begun to sense the vastness she contains but she does not know what it is or what it means. It's terrifying, this wilderness inside her. She has let the salt wash off her body.  When the leaf-birds fly she faces the dark interior of the cave.  \n\nThe Bank finds a dead doe at the bottom of the cliff-face.  It must have lost its footing and tumbled down.  She stares up at the precipice.  Then she kneels beside the doe and brushes the flies from its wide, glassy eyes.\n\n\n",

It\u2019s dark and the walls crowd in and the smell hits your nose and throat like black smoke.  \n\nBut he\u2019s still smiling.

You pick up an old clock face and hold it close to your eyes so you can read it through your cataracts.\n\nLook, he says, his accent thick on the word; you turn to see him pointing and smiling.  I show, he says.\n\nOn a sodden crate in the center of the room is an old record player, wired to a hand crank generator, the whole thing flimsy and cobbled together.  He dances around it, grunting, making adjustments, fiddling, and finally places a record gingerly onto the turntable.  \n\nCome, he says, still smiling.  You take a step towards him as he begins to turn the crank.\n\nThen there\u2019s music.\n\nOh, you say, an involuntary sound.  Oh. Like something you\u2019d say in your sleep.\n\nIt\u2019s a symphony, one you used to know well.  It fills the entire hollow of the room and rises to the ceiling and you push up against your tattered, mismatched shoes, straining after it.  \n\nI haven\u2019t heard this in a long time, you say.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t seem to understand, but he smiles.  You want to think of another way to say it, a simpler phrase, something kind to thank him with, and as you work it over in your mind, trying to form the right words, something swells in your chest and you burst out into sobs, gasping convulsively, unable to catch your breath, holding your face, and you kneel on the floor, head on your knee, crying as a child does, with everything.\n\nHe stops turning the crank and sits back in his chair, but the generator holds a charge now and the music plays loudly, carrying up and out to the road, and he hums the tune. \n\n\n",

Each is comprised of two components: a brief narrative, composed in a general-purpose mathematical metalanguage, and a set of coordinates.<br><br> Translating the narratives posed no challenge to early Encyclopedologists; it  was immediately clear from their contents that the Encyclopedia, as a whole, is an index of death and destruction on global scales. The meaning of the coordinates, however, remained a mystery for many decades. Finally, a handful of 'miracle' entries in which the relationship between distinct coordinate sets precisely mirrored the mappable locations of star systems within our own visible universe helped us to arrive at a fuller understanding of the Encyclopedia's structure and purpose: the narrative contained in each entry, we now believe, represents an apocalypse that occurred on the planet located at the corresponding coordinate point.<br><br> Some entries refer to worlds that are relatively close by.  Of course, in the abysmally vast majority, the coordinates appear to indicate locations beyond our particle horizon, and therefore, invisible from Earth.<br><br>Naturally, there is a great deal of debate as to what these entries truly mean:  does each narrative actually represent the lived experience of beings on such far-flung worlds? If so, how could the Encyclopedia gather information from planets billions of light years apart, and that could not possibly have been in touch with one another?<br><br>Such questions might push our credulity to its breaking point if not for the immovable, irrefutable existence of the Encyclopedia itself. |hookname19>[<b><br><br><br>\u25cfHas an understanding of the Encyclopedia's mapping system had an impact on cosmology and astronomy?</b>] (click-append: ?hookname19)[<br><br>Yes.<br><br>The Encyclopedia has allowed us to extrapolate both the size of the entire universe and our location within it. And perhaps it will one day lead us to direct contact with extraterrestrials: at present, the coordinates of entries in the Encyclopedia Apocalyptica have been used as a means of discovering new Earth-like planets in our galaxy a total of eight hundred and twenty-two times.]|hookname4>[<br><br><br><b>\u25cfHow might the narrative components of the entries be characterized?</b>] (click-append: ?hookname4)[<br><br>Each entry of the Encyclopedia Apocalyptica contains a brief narrative fragment, devoid of context.  The perspective, tone, and general character of these fragments differ from entry to entry.  Many are small flashes of experience, recorded from a first-person perspective.  Some appear to be dialogues between two or more speakers.  Some are broader considerations of entire civilizations.  Others are less easily categorized, however, and still others read, to us, as gibberish.  At the individual level, the entries often appear to have nothing to do with one another.<br><br>Taken as a larger dataset, the common thread running through entries of the Encyclopedia Apocalyptica is clear:  each is a window into the collapse of a unique extraterrestrial society on a distant planet.  Some capture moments that appear to precede the end of a civilization; some capture the moment of collapse itself; some capture moments from the chaotic time following the event that triggers the destruction of a people.]|hookname6>[<br><br><br><b>\u25cfWho writes the entries and how do they get into the Encyclopedia?</b>] (click-append: ?hookname6)[<br><br>We do not know.<br><br>They don't appear to have been \u2018written\u2019 in any traditional sense, especially given that many seem to describe worlds that were utterly destroyed.  Furthermore, it is unclear how anyone would upload entries to the Encyclopedia.  The most widely-held theory is that the Encyclopedia itself somehow mechanically captures or records these narrative bursts from the lived experience of those on dying worlds.  Encyclopedologists have taken to referring to entries as 'captures,' in fact.<br><br>Skeptics caution that we do not have enough information to draw conclusions. But when faced with the evidence of the document itself, we must ask: is the Encyclopedia Apocalyptica capable of scanning the entire universe and recording the experience of societal collapse in text?  Is, perhaps, the Encyclopedia itself an intelligent entity?  Is there a conscious mind informing its actions? Does it know how to 'listen' for apocalypses? And if so, could we use it to help prevent one on Earth? Is it aware that we have discovered it? Might we one day speak directly to the Encyclopedia? <br><br>We cannot yet answer these questions.  We can only continue to study the text: new entries appear at an average of twenty-six per day.|hookname7>[<br><br><br><b>\u25cfDoes this mean that an average of twenty-six worlds per day experience some manner of apocalypse?  Some immense number of civilizations throughout the universe, therefore, is on the verge of collapse?  </b>] (click-append: ?hookname7)[<br><br>Given our observations of the data collected in the Encyclopedia, we must conclude that, yes, civilizations throughout the universe are collapsing constantly.  Others, presumably, are thriving.  But the Encyclopedia only appears to capture data from worlds in some stage of death.|hookname8>[<br><br><br><b>\u25cfDoes the Encyclopedia Apocalyptica therefore constitute proof of extraterrestrial life?</b>] (click-append: ?hookname8)[<br><br>We must tentatively conclude that yes, it does.  Its very existence appears to necessitate it.  And the entries, if valid and accurate, would indicate that our universe is rich with life.  Of course, we have yet to substantiate the validity of any entry with physical evidence.  But we have found one that corresponds to a planet in the Proxima Centauri system.  Any archaeological evidence found on that planet could represent an enormous step towards demonstrating the larger validity of the Encyclopedia Apocalyptica.<br><br>The construction of the laser-sail ship Discovery-2, designed to travel to Proxima Centauri, is currently stalled as the project awaits more funding.]|hookname10>[<br><br><br><b>\u25cfCould the Encyclopedia Apocalyptica be a hoax?  Might it be procedurally generated, for instance, by software written on Earth?</b>] (click-append: ?hookname10)[<br><br>Though many have argued as much over the years, it appears extremely unlikely.  Its origin has been verified as non-terrestrial. The hoax theory, however, has remained perennially popular with conspiracy theorists.]]]|hookname11>[<br><br><br><b>\u25cfWho translates the entries into English?</b>] (click-append: ?hookname11)[<br><br>A constantly working team of professional and amateur Encyclopedologists.  The raw data of the Encyclopedia is available to the general public; if you would like to help translate, there are many resources available through a quick web search to help you get started.|hookname20>[<br><br><br><b>\u25cfIsn't translation of such a document a dangerous endeavor?  Isn't there a risk of anthropocentrizing the entries, even if only in subtle or unconscious ways, rendering them useless as information sources? Who are we to presume ourselves capable of this sort of translation?</b>] (click-append: ?hookname20)[<br><br>Most in the translation community have, in fact, embraced the trend towards anthropocentrism.  The general consensus is that the phrase 'great sea mammal,' for instance, can and should be translated as 'whale' to accommodate the needs of readers on Earth.  Why should the Encyclopedia be rendered sterile by means of a mechanical, unfeeling translation?  Why shouldn't these extinct worlds be made to feel real to us here on ours?<br><br>Only the most hard-line fundamentalists insist on strictly literal or procedural translations of the Encyclopedia.]|hookname12>[<br><br><br><b>\u25cfHas the entire Encyclopedia been translated?</b>] (click-append: ?hookname12)[<br><br>No.  Though the newest entries are now automatically translated and archived on a daily basis, much of the backlog is still undiscovered.]]]]\n\n\n\n\n[[\u25ce|faq]]",
