Tears pouring form her eyes at the mention of her husband.\n\n\"He gathered a few men from around town, and they went into the w-woods on a hunt.

I'll try and find this locket for you, but I expect payment.\"\nThere was no sympathy in his voice, he stated it all factually, but as soon as Jacobi had finished speaking she leapt from the ground.\n\"Thankyou, th-thankyou,\" she cried, \"I promise you, you will be paid in full.\"\nAnd with that she walked inside a house she was next to, smiling at Jacobi as she did so.\n[[Walk The Streets|Villagers]]",

As he turned the corner onto the main street he saw her there. In the building she was crying next to he spotted her in the window. Crying profusely, and tieing a knot in a thick rope.\nJacobi's stomach instantly leapt into his throat.//Stupid girl is going to hang herself!// he thought. Rushing towards the front door he reached it within seconds and quickly went to bashing the lock in. \nAt the first sound of a crash against the door he could hear her screaming, \n\"Don't come in! Please, just leave me alone!\" \nHer crying still audible through her yells.\n\"Dammit, you fool! It's Jacobi! I found your husband's locket now just open the bloody door!\"\nAnd with that final yell the door's lock gave way, and Jacobi tumbled into the room just in time to see Miranda place the noose around her neck. Their eyes locked for only a second before she kicked the chair out from underneath her. She began to kick and choke, tears still falling from her eyes, a sthough she would still be in agony even after death.\n\nWith only moments to react, Jacobi rushed forward into the room. Pulling out his $weapon he slashed across the rope holding up her choking, convulsing corpse. The rope gave way to the sharpened blade almost instantly, dropping Miranda to the ground.\n\nShe breathed, and Jacobi let out a sigh of relief. He sat down on the floor and held up her head, resting it upon his leg.\n\"I have something for you, you daft girl,\" he said, shaking, as he pulled the gold pendant from his back pocket.\n\"If you've got this then I don't see any reason to go looking for him, understand?\" he said, staring at the rope still hanging loosely around Miranda's neck.\n\nShe stared at the locket for a long time, before finally letting out another bout of tears. But these were different, they were tears of joy, and in between Jacobi could hear he whispering \"Thankyou..\".\nShe slowly pulled the rope from around her neck. and then removed a small necklace whic held a green gem inside gold caging.\nShe stifles her tears, \"Timothy once said this necklae would keep me safe if he were never here,\" she said, wiping tears from her eyes. \"But now I have him back,\" she forced out, blubbering over the wedding pendant she held in her other hand.\n\"Take it,\" she said, handing the green necklace to Jacobi, \"As your reward. you certainly need it more then I do.\"\n\nAnd with that she stood up, threw the rope into her dead fireplace and hugged Jacobi.\n\"Good luck, my friend\", she said, holding him for a few moments longer.\n\nAs Jacobi left Miranda's abode he placed the green necklace around his neck. The gem felt warm and comforting against his skin, promising safety and warmth, and have Jacobi a small spark of hope that his future would be just a little brighter with it. \n\n+1 Green Gem Necklace\n\n[[Return to Mayazar]]\n<<set $armourValue to $armourValue+1>>\n<<set $goldTLocket to false>>",

The tree's large, thick roots acted as walls for what this thing might have called a home. Branches and twigs were piled around the edges in an attempt to camoflage it's home from predators and prey, while inside lay a bed of leaves the ghoul would have used for sleep.\n\nSearching the hovel, Jacobi found few items of interest. Rusted and blood covered armour and swords lay scattered within. Practically all of which seemed useless and broken. Upon searching further, Jacobi found a small pouch hidden within a breastplate, alongside a small note. Th note itself was illegible, stained with blood and crumbled beyond recognition. However, along the top Jacobi spied the mark of King Twinning.\n//It appears im not the only fool he's sent out into these woods,// he thought as he unraveled the sack, revealing a small handful of coins.\n//Ha, and he only gave these bastards silver. Seems if you want something done right, then offer up some gold. Mine had better be waiting for me.//\nAmong the armour and weapons he also found a small locked box.

The man had trained Jacobi in his earlier years and led his troupe to battle many years ago, but Elias' true passion was for the crafting of weaponry and armour. As he walked into the open aired front section of the Smith he could smell the burning steel and coals of the fire, and it brought back pleasant memories of his youth training at Elias' orginal forge in the roaming green planes just northwest of Mayazar.\n\nHowever, his thoughts were disrupted by the coarse, scratchy yell of \"My word, if it isn't the Great Monster Hunter, Jacobi himself. Come here you mad devil!\". Elias put his hammer down and hobbled over towards Jacobi, picking him up in a squeezing hug with his enourmous, tree-trunk like arms.\n\"Elias, I can't- breathe, you old fool,\" squaked Jacobi, surprised by his old mentor's youthful strength and eagerness to recieve him.\n\"Well I can guess you're not here on a personal visit,\" Elias said as he dropped Jacobi on the dirt with an audible thud.\nJacobi coughed, and regained his footing, \"Unfortunately not old friend,\" he said clasping Elias' soot covered hands. \"I've got a job to do, and sadly this old armour won't do. Any chance of helping an old friend out?\"\n\nElias laughed, a booming sound echoing throughout the Smithy. \"Old friend? My boy I think you're the only friend I've got left after these last few years of strife. I tell you what, leave that leather gear here and come back here just before sundown, and I'll have something wonderful for you.\"\n\"Thankyou, Elias.

The road North was more well kept than the one towards Toreal. Paved with brick for what seemed like endless miles, the road was commonly used by the armies of Mayazar sent through the the Northern Keep of Salazhar and was one maintained to reflect this. These days, however, the road had fallen into disreppair, and the longer Jacobi rode, the more broken road he saw.\n\nRiding through the night Jacobi stopped only to rest when his horse finally gave in and stopped, refusing to ride any longer and gasping for air. It was time to rest.Dismounting, Jcaobi led his mount away and found a small stream, a few hundred feet few away from the road.

Burns, bloodstains and cracks lined the lower walls, a testament to the structures agelessness. An onlooker may see these and assume the walls were ready to crumble, but those who had seen inside knew the slabs used to build the walls were as thick as on oxen cart, and would not be crumbling any time soon.\n\nJacobi entered the Palace through the main hall, and found a guard waiting to take his weapons in the halls' antechamber.\n//Just do what he wants and get out of here Jacobi,// he thought to himself, unhitching his $weapon from his belt. Entering the main hall he spotted a man at the far end, beholding one of the great tapestries of history that ran around the hall's walls.

Pictured on it was a mountain fortress, covered in armed soldiers. It depicted a battle from the King's glory days, when he and 200 men held the fortress against an oncoming horde of undead. The Fight of Life, many called it, before the Necromancer behind the evil deeds was finally captured and beheaded in the centre of Mayazar\n\"The great Northern Keep of Salazhar,\" said Edward, reminsicing in his glory days, \"We held it long enough for my father's army to arrive, I remember the scolding he gave me afterwards, warning me not to put my life at risk like that again.\"\n\nHe paused for a moment, the man clearly respected his history, glancing around at the other tapestries around the room. It was common knowledge that King Twinning wanted to be remembered as a great king, if not the greatest that Mayazar had ever seen. He held history books and tapestries covering every one of the exploits and conquerings completed during his and his family's reign, and nothing would stop him from seeing his dream through until the end.\n\nContinuing, he stated \"It's been many years since that time, and the men in the north have become weak. I've recieved word that cultists have attacked once more from beyond the mountains, and I'd rather not risk an uprising in my lifetime.\"\nHe turned and began walking toward a chair at the hall's immensely long table. Taking his time to sit, he continued after saying \"I need someone to go there and sort this out, someone I know can handle this task. Someone like you Jacobi. I know you were promised Gold and that you could leave to attend to your own business, but I need you up North. Route out the one behind this and I will double what you were promised, and we can forget about that unpleasentness in the war.\"\nHe paused for a moment as Jacobi considered his options.\n\n\"You know, the more Gold you have, the more medicine you can get for Cassandra\", he said calmly, looking away from Jacobi.

Jacobi was repulsed by what he saw, stepping back for a moment.\n\nUpon closer inspection however, he saw that the mother was wearing a small green armband that appeared to glow as he moved closer to it. //Cultists they were not, but someone gave them this,// he thought, slowly pulling the armband off of the mangled corpse. It was cold to the touch, like holding a chunk of snow in his hands, despite the fact it was still Summer. He put it around his own arm and instantly felt better, healthier almost.//A trinket for a loved one I suppose.

But luckily I had time, and your armour is ready.\" He waved his hammer to the side of the Smithy and Jacobi followed it's direction.\n\nOn the table against the wall lay a full suit of steel plated leather armour. \"It's the best I could do on short notice. The steel should add some protection for you. And since when did you use such heavy leather? I can't imagine you moving very freely in that thing. Anyway I cut away some of the uneccessary pieces around your inner though and arms. It should be a great deal lighter now.\"\nElias continued to hammer away against his anvil, making a blade for a LongSword by what Jacobi could tell.\n\"Now get going, you wouldn't have needed that in a hurry if you didn't have somewhere you needed to be.\"\n\"Thankyou old friend,\" Jacobi whispered, and sunk away from the Smithy.

Jumping to his feet and quickly grabbing his $weapon he dropped into a defensive stance, readying himself for an attack.\n\nIt was then he heard a distinctly feminine yelp and the scurrying stopped. Slowly, he inched his way towards the bushes. \"Whoever you are, come out and I promise no harm will come to you,\" said Jacobi, tightening his grip on his weapon's handle.\n\nAt this command, however, the bushes moved once more, and a small elderly woman slowly edged her way out in the clearing he had made his camp for the night. It was obvious to Jacobi she was a gypsy woman, a travelling saleswoman and purveyour of magic trinkets. But the elder of his youth always warned him of their kind, cheats as they were all known to be.\n\nOn her back she held a large pack; straw and twigs piled on top of her sack of snake oil, false truths and trinkets. Jacobi sighed, \"Leave me before I change my mind on killing you, damn gypsy.\" \n\"But sir,\" she said, a smile widening across her face and a mishcevious look stirring in her eyes \"You're ehading North, to the place of danger. Dark energies swirl and the cult dances through the night. I can see it in your eye, the way it darts to and fro across the mountain range.\"\n \nHer voice was shrill and high pitched, seemingly as wildly worded as her hair, tattered in knots and frays and quite unsightly. The woman had not seen civilization in a long time, Jacobi surmised.\n\"If I am it's of no business to you,\" Jacobi said. He sheathed his $weapon and began packing his sleeping roll and equipping his armour, paying no more attention to the old hag.\n\n\"But sir what I hold here is what you need.

All the mean still wore their armour, with some having even passed out near the edges still wearing theirs.\n\nNearby, some guards searched through a destroyed wreckage of a cottage, and upon further inspection Jacobi saw that an entire small village had been practically toppled around them.//Damn these bastards must be strong. What the hell have I gotten myself into.//\n\nIn the centre of the camp was Salazhar Quartermaster and head of supplies. He lookd tired and wated away, as though a breeze would take him if he let go of his table.//He might be of use,// Jacobi thought, tieing his horse to a nearby hitching post. //I might even be able to track some of the cultists around here before I go in if I get a chance.//\n\nAs he entered the camp he was greeted by the man in charge, a frail redheaded man who held a pile of parchments with order from high up. As he approached Jacobi, Jacobi pulled out the orders he had been given by the King and handed it to the man. Upon reading he quickly closed his mouth of whatever he was about to say, and left Jacobi to go about his business.\n<<else>>\nJacobi looked around the outpost, eyeing off the weary men and wondering how long it would be before they decided to turn tail and run.

His leadership role was clearly unexpected, probably past on to him due to the last captain having died within the Keep. \"The letter from the King clearly states you are to enter with our help, and we do have a strategy.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" queried Jacobi, becoming interested in what the young mna had to say.\n\"Once nightfall hits we are to take a ladder to one of the lower windows. There, a small well-armed team will infiltrate the Keep. The cultists have no real military strategy, so we don't expect heavy resistance. They believe their magic to be all-powerful and unstoppable, but the men here will change their view.\" As he began talking, he lost his stutter and had become entranced by his own military prowess. //Maybe this kid is a good leader,// thought Jacobi.\n\n\"Here, we will need someone to get to the lever which controls the main gate, if we can get that open our forces should be able to pour through and deal with whatever is left\"\n\"And I'm to get to that lever, correct?\" asked Jacobi.\n\"Unfortunately, yes. You're the most skilled fighter here and the King's letter states you are to be the vanguard.\"\n//Of course it does, bloody bastard.//\n\t<<if $robe is true>>\n\"If its all the same to you, I have another way in. If we co-ordinate attacks your men can keep the bulk of their forces busy while I find the lever.\" Jacobi said, thinking of the hidden entrance he had seen the cultists use earlier.\n\nThe commander's face dropped, \"Ah, I s-suppose so, but you had better find that lever or we'll be pulling out as soon as possible.\"\n\"Of course, sir,\" Jacobi said, with a mocking salute.\n\t<<endif>>\n<<else>>\nJacobi made his way towards the group of men preparing for another attack. The commander ran him through the plan again of sneaking in under the cover of darkness.\n//Let's hope we can kill the bastards this time,// he thought, making his way towards the entance.\n<<endif>>\n\n[[Check Inventory|Supplies]]\n[[Wait For Nightfall|Nightfall]]\n<<nobr>>\n\n\t<<if $robe is false>>\n\t\t<<set $positionX to 1>>\n\t\t<<set $positionY to 4>>\n\t<<elseif $robe is true>>\n\t\t<<set $positionX to 6>>\n\t\t<<set $positionY to 1>>\n\t<<endif>>\n\t\t<<set $attackNumber to 0>>\n\t\t<<set $torchlight to 0>>\n<</nobr>>\n\n<<silently>>\n<<set $bMapArray to\n[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],\n[0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,5,1,0],\n[0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0],\n[0,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,1,1,0],\n[0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,0],\n[0,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,0],\n[0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]>>\n<</silently>>\n\n",

Lieing there, bound and gagged, was a frightened Guardsman, attempting to plead for his life before the madman. Jacobi quickly rushed forward to attack before the man was killed, and gave away his position in attempting to do so.\n\nDrawing his weapon as the figure turned he struck without hesitation, but whoever he was fighting, they were fast too. A glancing blow meant to sever the spine was barely dodged, and the robe was caught and ripped on Jacobi's $weapon, revealing the one beneath. \n\nA young woman with hair in tatters and knots, scriptures burnt across one side of her face and further down her neck. There was blood dripping from the side of her head, clearly Jacobi's attack had still wounded her, though to do the degree of his liking. The robe still hid more of her aberrations, but as she moved away from Jacobi, preparing for combat, he could something slowly slide out of a sleeve from the robe. \n\nA long tentacle, covered in bloodred spikes and the colour of bruised flesh slithered out. Thought not as thick and gruesome as those of the ones Jacobi fouught before, it looked far deadlier and faster. As it moved, she began to wave it around herself, and like a whip deisgned for brutal combat she snapped her arm forward and flung it towards Jacobi.\n\n[[Dodge Attack|Dodge Cult Leader]]\n[[Block Attack|Block Cult Leader]]\n<<set $cultLHealth to 50>>",

Mounting the horse he though ot himself, //I hear the beaches of Lyandria are good this time of year. Perhaps we can live in peace there.//\n\nBut his thoughts of a brighter future were cut short, and as he was about to leave the Outpost, the young commander began running to catch up to him.\n\"Jacobi!,\" he yelled with urgency, quickly running out of breath.\n//Does this have no end?// he asked himself, bringing the horse to a stop. The commander stopped for a moment to catch his breath as he caught Jacobi. The night air was still cold and thinning, and he would need a moment.\n\n\"A messenger arrived,\" he gasped, \"from the capital. Says he n-needs to speak with you immediately. King's Orders.\" He poined towards the centre of camp near the fire. There stood a relatively regal looking knight, and upon closer inspection Jacobi realized it was none other than a memebr of the elite King's Guard. //Whatever it is he isn't kidding around sending one of his personal guards. But I'm done with all this, whatever he wants, I've paid my dues to the King. Best go tell him to sodd off.//\n\nJacobi dismounted leaving his horse at the edge of camp.

It now seemed to glow softly, and the blade shined brightly in the moonlight, aching to be used.\n<<endif>>\nJacobi approached the King's Guard messenger slowly, dreading whatever message Twinning had sent for him.\n\nThe man was wearing full plate steel armour, lined with golden edging, and had a regal look about him, standing tall and proud while others around him hunched around the fire. As Jacobi approached , the man reached to his belt, pulling out a sealed scroll. \"A message for Ser Jacobi Kozlov, from his lordhsip King Twinning. I've also been instructed to ensure your return to the capital.\"\nThe man spoke quickly and with purpose, confident in his mission from the King.\n\nJacobi took the letter from his hand and broke the wax seal with a dull hunting knife. \n[[Read Letter]]",

But you, good sir, you cleaved through their forces like they were nothing.\"\n\nJacobi began to smile coyly, it had been a while since anyone had actually thanked him for his work.\n\"The men have had a difficult time since being forcefully removed from what might as well have been their home. A morale boost certainly is in order.\" he continued, glancing towards the Keep, the first of the Guardsmen now beginning to walk out after the battle.\n\nMany of them that Jacobi had seen were holding the robes, or parts of, belonging to the cultists, as if they were trophies of their kills. Some had even taing them to tieing them to poles as a warning flag for others that would try to take the keep. \"Ah yes a morale boost indeed,\" said the Quartermaster, watching the men as Jacobi was.\n\n\"And I believe you found a great deal of those robes in there as well, did you not?\" he asked, gleefully.\n\"The fabric was a good material, and I was hoping I might make some coin from them. Unless you have a better offer?\" asked Jacobi. He could see where the Quartermaster was going with his little spiel and hoped a bit of friendly negotiation would do the trick.\n\n\"Well, depends on how many you have.

The King's Guard, Ser Joren Fletcher, I have sent with this letter is to escort you to the Eastern fishing village Fjorna, just a day's ride from Salazhar Keep.//\n\n//Reports sent by carrier pidgeon from our Northern Allies suggest that although many of the cultists escaped to the Keep, men were seen leaving their forces and taking ships to sail around the mountains. As Fjorna is the first village past this mountain range, military experts believe that the town could now very well be infested with these scum.//\n\n//We are to take no chances with these people, and by order of the myself, King Edward Twinning, I demand you go to this village and root out any possible cultist infestation. Burn it to the ground and leave no soul alive, for the infection of the cultist's madness spreads fast and we cannot risk an uprising from within our lands.//\n\n//Burn the village to the ground, and destroy the infestation. Should you refuse this order, you will be branded an an enemy of the realm. You, and the ones you love, will be drawn and quartered in the streets.

But it seemed that end was fast approaching for Jacobi, his actions quite possibly costing him his happy future.\n\nHe appraoched the hitching post just outside of his cottage, and imediately saw that something wasn't right. The front door was hanging wide open, and mud and dirt had been smeared all across the front porch, as though a struggle of some sort had taken place here.\n\nQuickly Jacobi ran inside, and his worse fears were confirmed. His home had been ransacked; cupboards lay wide open and empty, his food stores had been emptied, and Cassandra was no where to be seen.\n\nHe ran to the bedroom, looking frantically for his beloved wife. Still no where to be found.

She had clearly been deprived her daily medicinal treatment, and was shaking, terrified of the men around her and what they would do.\n\nBetween them, a small platoon of Guards kept watch, a dozen at least by Jacobi's count.

Jacobi had only seconds to react before one of the saws violently launched itself towards him, being rudely forced out of the contraption.\n\nBarely escaping in time, the blade cut across Jacobi's forearm, the wound spitting blood almost instantaneously.\n//Shit I need to wrap this now!// he thought, frantically searching his bad for a roll of gauze. His hand rested on a coarse piece of fabric, and he pulled it out of the bag, revealing a small roll of gauze for the wound. Moving quickly, he wrapped his arm and halted the flow of blood.\n\nSitting quietly, Jacobi took a moment to regain his breath and let his body recover for a few minutes.\n//No wonder this place is empty, the workers must be terrified of that bloody thing.//\n<<set $logger to true>>\n[[Continue Searching Logging Camp|Logging Camp]]\n[[Return to Town|Toreal]]\n\n<<set $gauze to $gauze-1>>\n<<if $gauze lt 0>>\n\t<<set $gauze to 0>>\n<<endif>>\n<<set $logger to true>>",

His body was still warm when the King's Guard threw him to the hunting dogs.\n\n\nLoad a save file or restart the game from the sidebar.\n<---",

As he moved closer to the centre of the room, King Twinning's face dropped in terror, as he saw his life begin to flash before his eyes.\n\nBefore the King had even a chance to slide the knife at Cassandra's throat, Jacobi was upon him. The King swiftky reached for his cane, revealing a hidden blade within and attempted to thrust it towards Jacobi. In those moments time seemed to slow for the two men, Jacobi's $weapon pierced into Twinning's chest spilling his corrupted blood, jewlery adorning his royal clothing dropping to the ground and ringing out like a bell in the great hall.\n\nJacobi looked down at the former King, choking on his own blood. Unfortunately Jacobi presumed he would be doing the same soon, as Twinning's rapier had pierced his side, and his only respite was the fact that the guards were still in shock. He looked towards Cassandra, grabbing a handful of the jewlery that had fallen before him. //She must live, even if I don't.//\n\nIn one smooth motion he grabbed a handful of the largest gems he could see and threw them towards Cassandra.\n\"Go! Get to Elias, he can still help you!\" he shouted, turning to face the remaining Guardsmen.\n\"Jacobi!\" she began, tears filling her eyes once more.\n\"I said GO!!\" he yelled, turning back to see the woman he loved one last time as she began to run for the Palace Gates\n//Now I just need to hold them off,// he thought.\n\"Come to me cowards!\" he yelled, raising his $weapon for his final battle.\n<<set $Ending to 1>>\n<<else>>\n//Jacobi dies killing King Twinning, Cassandra runs to Elias, tears in her eyes as she saw her husband die.//\nJacobi dashed  through the crowd of Guardsmen, parrying and evading their attacks as his wounds began to take effect, blood slowly pouring from his body. As he staggered his way towards the center of the room, twinning dropped the knife at Cassandra's throat and reached for his cane with inexplicable speed, revealing a hidden rapier within and thrust it towards Jacobi as the Monster hunter made his approach.\n\nThe two men met each other with a single blow. Twinning aiming for Jacobi's already emptying wounds, and Jacobi stabbing his $weapon into the man's chest. They stood for a moment, both held up by the other's blades. Looking past Twinnning and into the eyes of his beloved Cassandra, Jacobi coughed up a message.\n\"Get, to Elias. He, can help.\"\nAnd with his final pools of strength, Jacobi flung the King off of his blade and into the nearest Guardsman, armour and jewelry dropping to the floor. As Cassandra ran for the exit, the Guardsmen too shocked by the death of Twinnning to stop her, Jacobi took one final glance at the woman he loved, before his eye closed one final time.\n<<set $Ending to 2>>\n<<endif>>\n[[Epilogue]]",

The evening sun had cast an orange glow across the water and into the nearby village of Alderleaf, where the local alchemists and phsyicians were preparing themselves for the night.\n\nSitting on a rocking chair on her cottage's small porch, she smiled, as for the first time since Jacobi's sacrfice she finally began to feel at peace. //So this is what you wanted for us,// she thought, a single tear rolling down her face. She rose from the chair and began to walk towards the water, plucking a flower from he small garden as she passed it by.\n\nAt the water's edge, a small gravestone lay hidden next to a mound of boulders.
