Especially in describing physical locations, and in the spirit of the story, I have spliced in bits of Hawthorne's (and occasionally Emerson's) writing in with my own. Specifically, I have used bits of Young Goodman Brown, The Birthmark, and the descriptions of The Old Manse from Mosses from an Old Manse. I've also used some writings in the Ripley and Thayer family papers, which describe the parsonage and its history. For many of the sci-fi descriptions and some writing quirks, I looked to Sterling Lanier's papers in Houghton, which include letters, short stories (written by him and others) and other personal papers. There are a few other items I referenced, but they are all clearly described in the story (library items on display, etc.). \n\nWith so many sources and sneaky quotations, one might question the originality of the story and writing. I can confidently say that the story is very much my own, and the amalgam of sources is the very spirit of the story. With all of that said, if a description of nature seems particularly eloquent, it's probably Hawthorne! \n\n-\n\n''Acknowledgements''\n\n''This project was supported with a fellowship from Harvard University\u2019s Houghton Library on the occasion of their 75th Anniversary.''\n\n{(live: 2s)[\n    (either: \"A huge\", \"A //special//\", \"An ''eternal''\", \"An IMPORTANT\")\n]} thank you to my mentors, guides, and the amazing creators of the fellowship: \nHeather Cole and Emilie Hardman. \n\n{(live: 2s)[\n    (either: \"A huge\", \"A //special//\", \"An ''eternal''\", \"An IMPORTANT\")\n]} thank you to my cohort: \nAllison Law, Mario Menendez, Jensen Davis, Leon Pan, and Tawanda Mulalu. \n\n{(live: 2s)[\n    (either: \"A huge\", \"A //special//\", \"An ''eternal''\", \"An IMPORTANT\")\n]} thank you to all of the Houghton Staff who answered all my questions and showed me the magic of the library. \n\n{(live: 2s)[\n    (either: \"A huge\", \"A //special//\", \"An ''eternal''\", \"An IMPORTANT\")\n]} thank you to my beta testers:\nAllison Law, Mario Menendez, Jensen Davis, Leon Pan, and Tawanda Mulalu, Emilie Hardman, Heather Cole, Paul Ingemi, Ryan Wheeler, and Nadia Haile.\n\n[[Back.|Introduction]]",

(click:\"piece of paper\")[It reads:\n\n//An orchard has a relation to mankind, and readily connects itself with matters of the heart. The trees possess a domestic character; they have lost the wild nature of their forest-kindred, and have grown humanized by receiving the care of man, as well as by contributing to his wants. There is so much individuality of character, too, among apple-trees, that it gives them an additional claim to be the objects of human interest. One is harsh and crabbed in its manifestations; another gives us fruit as mild as charity. One is churlish and illiberal, evidently grudging the few apples that it bears; another exhausts itself in free-hearted benevolence.//]\n\n",
