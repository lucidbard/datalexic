After the last one had passed her and Otilia was about to go to her own quarters. A straggler stepped into the cloister.</p>\n\t\t<p class =\"blueCap\">It was Ysabella, the cellera. She will have been to the latrines. Thought Otilia and decided to wait for her. How surprised was she when Ysabella, without a word, grabbed her arm and pulled her into the chapter hall.</p>\n\t\t<p class =\"redCap\">The sun had already begun to set and the thick, stained windows of the hall let in but little light. In the darkness, Otilia could not make out what it was that the cellera laid into her hands. It's from my cousin, she whispered, and quickly escaped out of the hall and up the stairs.</p>\n\t\t<p class =\"blueCap\">The abbess was not quite sure whether she had rightly heard suppressed laughter from upstairs when she passed the stairs to the dormitorium. Quickly she left for her quarters to take a look at the gift she had just received and upon arrving there, with much anticipation, she lit the candles on her desk to confirm what by now she had come to suspect it was by the parcel's touch.</p>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"verso\">\n\t<div class=\"vtext\" lang =\"en\">\n\t\t<p class =\"redCap\">And of course she had been right.
