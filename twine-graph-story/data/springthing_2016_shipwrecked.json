      "text": "Our esteemed author is a pilot of some small skill and no little ambition, hailing from the city of Dust in the high northern desert. His captain sparked a measure of literary ambition by lending him several well-loved dime novels to pass the time on the long run to the Crescent Cities. Assuming a satisfactory outcome, Ephram's legacy is detailed in the novel, [[Nothing Left to Wish For|http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QU5PO9G]].\\n\\nAndrew G. Schneider always wanted to be a wizard when he grew up; now he makes magic with words. When not writing, he hunts the wild dust bunny and makes a mean pot of French onion soup. He lives in Washington, D.C., believes in unicorns, and is married to a wonderful woman who believes in him. He is the writer and designer of the upcoming text adventure game, [[Nocked! True Tales of Robin Hood|http://www.nockedthegame.com]], the author of the sand-slinging, swashbuckling adventure novel, [[Nothing Left to Wish For|http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QU5PO9G]], and the Tales from a Coffee Shop Princess; [[Waiting for My Happily Ever After|http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017WJZZKG]] and [[Undercaffeinated and Overexposed|http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QU6ITFQ]].
