Before you know it you are in a huge pile of feathers, first up to your ankles, then up to your knees, then your waist, then your chest, then your shoulders, then your chin. The feather rain is coming down faster and harder now. The feather level keeps raising, past your mouth, your nose, your eyes, and finally the top of your head. You are buried under an avalanche of feathers. There are feathers absolutely everywhere. Feathers on top of you, feathers beneath you, feathers inside of you, feathers all around you, feathers behind you, feathers in front of you, feathers all over you, feathers touching every inch of your body. You feel the accumulated weight pressing down on you from above. Your vision is totally blocked by feathers. You open your mouth to breathe and your lungs fill up with feathers. The feathers go down your throat. You feel sick from the lump of feathers in your stomach. You feel feathers coursing through your veins. Your whole body fills up with feathers. You can't feel your feet on the ground anymore. Your are in a void of feathers. There is no up or down or forward. There isn't even towards-the-feathers and away-from-the-feathers. The feathers are everywhere and every direction is feathers. You have absolutely no sense of direction or gravity. You have no sense of balance. No feeling of heat. The earth's magnetic field does not reach you. There is no chance of a single ray of sunlight hitting you. Feathers are all you can sense. You see nothing but feathers, hear nothing but feathers, taste nothing but feathers, smell nothing but feathers, touch nothing but feathers. You have no identity, no concept of self. You and the feathers are indistinguishable. There is one substance which makes up the universe, and that substance is feathers. The feathers erase all space and all time. There has never been anything here but feathers. There will never be anything but feathers. When the big bang burst it unleashed only an infinity of feathers, and when the universe dies its heat death there will only be ice cold feathers left to mark its place. The feathers themselves are made of more feathers. Your brain no longer exists. Your mind no longer exists. Your self no longer exists. The only thing which could ever exist is feathers. Your thoughts dissipate into the vast mass of feathers. You have long since lost the ability to speak, but nothing you could ever say would be anything but feathers. No nouns but feathers. No verbs but feathers. No adjectives or adverbs but feathers. You have never loved, or hated, or felt joy or sorrow. You can only feel feathers. The feathers are total. The feathers exist. The feathers are there. There are feathers. Just feathers.

This option is doubly not recommended for a first playthrough since the button is buggy and will occasionally break the formatting. If you are using a mobile device you may need to rotate your screen into landscape mode to make the sidebar visible.\n\nEnable Undo is currently [(if:$undotoggle is 1)[ON](else:)[OFF]]<optionundo|.(click-replace: ?optionundo)[(display:\"setundo\")]",
