      "text": "-protag arrives to Eritan from Arctus. He's unknown in Eritan, but was famous in Arctus as a war hero. However, his famous image is secretly a lie. Plagued with guilt, he escaped to Eritan to start over anew and escape his image.\n\n-hipster Satyr mage, Theo.\n\n-shadowmancer rogue girl, Rowin.\n\n-werewolf girl: werewolves become wolves at night as their curse, however, since the night has not lifted over Eritan, she's stuck in wolf form. Lilah.\n\n-clockwork man: he just wants to be a person (not clockwork man, just man). at some point, if the player talks to him, he'll choose a new name, and ask for player's advice. his starting \"name\" is Sentry-9. the clockwork men are essentially human souls powering mechanical bodies, created by mages. He'll suggest three names that he likes equally: Adrian, Cyril, or Thomas. His class is basically rogue. \n\n-companions will now level up with your character. their level is initially set to the level of your character when you first meet them. they will have the option to learn new moves as they level up. \n\n-Mages: much like before, mages will learn new spells and focus on weaknesses/immunities. level up will allow learning new spells at certain levels, plus more MP (and more HP). \n\n-warriors: attacks will be set, but strength modifier increases with level ups. new weapons can add to the modifier, and also provide elemental damage types. no SP anymore, but HP increases with level also.\n\n-rogues: can dodge moves, with increasing chance of dodging with level. new weapons also provide damage type modification. they focus more on status effects and dodging, and being support for companion characters.\n\n-other combat changes: can control your companion now, who can also be targeted (some attacks will hit both?--more common with spells or enemies that represent multiple enemies). As before, if your character dies, game over, but if companion dies...?\n\n-completely open world this time? like that idea\n\n-combat options: mage - spell1, spell2, spell3. rogue - attack (basic+strength+weapon), affliction (?), dodge. warrior - attack (basic+strength+weapon), strong attack (must recharge next turn), taunt (draw attention of single-target attacks to you). \n\n-rogues' afflictions cause damage on the foe's turn and has a 4/5 chance of landing. rogues' dodge will succeed 2/3 chance. \n\n-warriors' reckless strike does double its base damage, but renders you unable to move next turn. \n\n-if you've used taunt and foe uses a multiattack, you get hit twice.\n\n-optional quest in the forest past Anurion: you find a werewolf group camping in the woods who explains an aggressive upstart upheaved their clan after decades of peace within. The quest-giver, Anselm, was former leader, and wants to reunite the clan so they can quietly live in peace in the caves again; they're endangered in the open woods. When you fight through the caves and get to Kudlak sitting with his wolves, Kudlak will suggest it's not your problem, that he bested Anselm and aggression is the werewolves' way, and it's no business to an outsider. Since Anselm dragged you into it, he'll offer you 100 silver to leave, and kill Anselm, with the additional promise that with Anselm dead, if the others wish to rejoin the caves, he'll allow them. Accepting Kudlak's offer results in +5 liveforself, killing him in +1 liveforother. If you kill him, the other werewolves in the room will respect/not attack you, though they say nothing.\n\n-final boss: Nephilim Dysdera",

You climb to your feet, gathering your senses as you look around you. You appear to be among a number of ships at the docks of a fair-sized coastal city. The sky above is dark and heavy with rain that is only now beginning to fall, fat drops of water landing around you as harbingers of a big storm. \n\n\"We're here, (if:$name is \"Sorrel\")[lass](else:)[lad],\" the captain says to you from over his shoulder, hearing you rise. He stands helping his small crew carry crates from the ship. \"Shiravelle Beach. Bit earlier than expected, I'd say early evenin', not that you'd know it from the sky.\"\n(if:$gamebeat is \"yes\")[(set:$bestiary's \"Nephilim Dysdera\" to 1)]\nHe takes off his cap with one hand and wipes sweat from his forehead with the other, looking seriously up at the stormclouds. \n\n\"I was you, I'd get indoors. We plan on making quick work of this here, likewise.\"\n\nHe turns to you as you walk past, and shakes your hand. \n\n\"I know if half what they say of you's true, you'll have no trouble makin' a name of yourself here, but...it's no easy thing to start fresh. Good luck, lad.\"\n\nThen, with a curt nod, he turns back to helping his men with the crates. \n\nYou step off of the ship and onto the wooden pier, with the wind picking up and rustling through your cloak and hair. \n\nA fresh start. Not a bad idea. \n\nIf you can leave your past in Arctus. \n\n[[Enter Shiravelle Beach.|shiravelle]]\n[[Menu|menu]]",

      "text": "About companions:\n\n-You can have only a single companion. This companion can be dismissed from the menu, but be warned: you will not be able to get them to rejoin you.\n\n-You can talk to companions at any time from the menu. Companions also keep track of how you talk to them, and their approval may create subtle differences...\n\n-In combat, you can control your companion's choices. Selecting the \"Hold Back\" command will cause them to not perform an action that turn. Companions have varying classes and movesets, and like you, can learn new skills as they level up. \n\n-You cannot change a companion's class or equipment, nor do they have access to your inventory. \n\n-You can view a companion's stats and descriptions of their known moves from the menu.\n\nGameplay tips:\n\n-In combat, many enemy creatures have weaknesses and/or immunities. An attack using a spell or weapon with an element that an enemy is weak to will deal extra damage, but an attack that uses an element that an enemy is immune to deals no damage at all. Once you have killed at least one of that type of enemy, its weakness and immunity will be listed in the bestiary, which can be accessed from the menu. \n\n-''Rogues'' have the highest speed, and so they can never be ambushed: rogues will always go first in combat. Rogues have mid-range defense, so they take somewhat reduced damage from enemy attacks. Rogues prefer to take chances, and while they have a normal Attack that is modified by their strength and equipped weapon, they have two unique skills: Dodge and Affliction. Dodge has a 67% chance of evading all damage next enemy turn (companions are unaffected). Affliction has an 80% of affecting the enemy with the equipped affliction. Rogues can learn new afflictions as they level up. As with Warriors, Rogues can take advantage of Weaknesses and Immunities by equipping weapons with damage types; rogues can equip bows and daggers.\n\n-''Warriors'' have the highest defense and strength. Like Rogues, Warriors can take advantage of Weaknesses and Immunities through the use of weapons with damage types. Warriors have a basic attack, modified by their strength and weapon. They also have the unique skills Taunt and Reckless Strike. Taunt does not deal damage, but will focus enemy attention on the player for the next turn, drawing it from your companion, if you have one. Reckless Strike is a powerful attack that deals double base damage, but renders you unable to move next turn. \n\n-''Mages'' have the least defense of all three classes. A mage focuses on learning a variety of spells insteading of equipping new weapons, as staffs do little damage and magic is a mage's true arsenal. Good mage combat strategy involves taking advantage of weaknesses and avoiding immunities while learning increasingly powerful spells.\n\n-It's helpful to keep track of forks in your path, as you may want to return to them later. If you're uncertain of where to go next, try finding an unexplored path that you left behind. \n\n-If you're stuck, try looking for options that you missed in the body of the passage itself. Any text that you can interact with will be highlighted in green when you hover over it. Additionally, occasionally talking to companions may yield some insight into the area you are currently in.\n\nOther:\n\n-You can save the game at any time from the menu. When you're ready to return to the game, select the \"Load saved game\" option from the beginning instead of starting a new game. \n\n-NOTE: the Load option is available as long as the game can find your save data. Game data is stored in your web browser, and so clearing your browser's cookies will delete your saved game.\n\n[[Back|menu]]",

There are only three rooms here in the small hall below a close ceiling. Your key doesn't work in the first one, but it does in the second, and you open your door and walk inside. \n\nA straw cot sits on a wooden frame against the wall; there is a crooked chair in the corner of the small room, and an oil lamp burns on a sidetable by the bed. Something scurries in a dark corner of the room, and rushes into a crack in the wooden panels of the wall. \n\nYou shut and lock the door, and then lie back on the straw bed. You wonder whether the mattress or your cramped quarters on the ship is the larger home to insects. As you rest, you can hear the driving of rain on the roof, just on the other side of the wooden boards above your head. More faintly, you can hear the swell of voices from the tavern floor, and occassional strains of quieter speech from the rooms below you. \n\nYou turn off the oil lamp and close your eyes. \n\n[[Eventually, you fade into sleep.|shiramorning]]",

Hmm...I suppose you're wondering who I am, first,\" she tells you, as you clamber through smooth, paved streets past bustling crowds. \n\nWalking behind her, you note an emblem on the back of her cloak: the image of a sandhill crane standing on foot, wings outstretched and head reared; its body gray save for the distinctive red patch on its head, above its eyes. \n\nAround you, the city is remarkably clean and of gorgeous design, and you wish you could stop and take it in, but the noble leads you through at breakneck speed.\n\n\"I'm Rowin, of house Carmine. The only human noble house in Southern Hold, in fact--I, and my family, are from Redcorry, the only primarily human settlement in Southern Hold. This city, Anurion, is one of the largest in the hold, and it's ruled by Lord Artimir. The latest news of this endless night that has befallen all of Eritan is that the best mages have finally identified its source--the source of the magic is here, in Southern Hold. Lord Artemir has been trying to organize the effort to go investigate it--and more realistically, to kill whatever's doing this,\" she tells you, speaking fairly effortlessly as you struggle to keep up. \n\nThen, suddenly, you stop. \n\n\"This way,\" she states, and then you follow the swish of her cloak into a grand palace, getting only a momentary glimpse of the fountains and statues outside. Then, you're within the grand palace. \n\nInside, you hear muted chatter and from somewhere, gentle lute music, along with the quiet trickle of running water. The floor is smooth marble. Alongside floor of the entrance hallway on either side is a stretch of water; the carved image of an obsidian heron standing with one foot resting on an overturned pitcher rests by the wall on either side, with water flowing from the pitchers into the pools. Colorful carp drift leisurely in the water. \n\nAs Rowin leads you into a main hall, you see a number of well-dressed elves, some of whom give you a polite smile as you pass. You enter a large room. Natural sunlight from a skylight above creates a spotlight on the center of the room, where broad-leafed green plants stand opposite a marble throne. Two obsidian heron statues mirror each other's stance before the throne, wings splayed and necks lowered as if in obeisance. \n\nSeated on the throne is quite possibly the most beautiful man you've ever seen. Lord Artemir sits calmly, an elf of deeply dark skin and tightly curled locks swept back and cascading over his right shoulder. He gives you an easy smile, and your chest stirs. \n\n\"Welcome,\" he says, standing, and gliding over to you. Rowin stands beside you. \"I am Artemir-//aewimorn//, Artemir the Black Heron.\"\n\n\"He's the $epithet, my lord,\" says Rowin. \n\n\"Is that so?\" Artemir says, turning to you without a hint of surprise. \"Certainly Rowin has briefed you...we have need of great heroes such as yourself at present.\"\n\nYou can feel your stomach sinking. What bitter irony. How? How did things end up here? \n\n\"Would you aid us?\" Artemir says. \n\nEvery fiber of your body desires to turn and bolt from the room. You look at Artemir's unreadable, steady gaze. \n\nIt's too late now. You'll have to play this out till the end. \n\n\n\n\n[[\"I suppose so.\"|supposeSo]]\n",

In a public announcement yesterday, Lady Aldana had this to say: \"I want to say it this time publicly, once and for all: Gautier and I are not a couple, never have been, nor will we ever be.

But, alas, a young usurper took advantage of the increased confusion recently and challenged me to combat--and won, taking control. And now, a usurper with violent attitudes is in control of most of my people, and I and my small group of followers who left with me will almost certainly be killed, out here in the open, if not by monsters, then by townspeople. \n\n\"I, Anselm, former wolf-king, humbly beg this of you, stranger: if you happen upon our caves, to the east of here, and you feel you are strong enough, you would have my endless gratitude if you kill Kudlak. The fate of us here in this camp aside, I fear he means to lead an attack on uncursed in his arrogance.\"\n(set:$talkedWere to \"yes\")\nAnselm stands. \"Whether or not you take this upon yourself, I thank you for listening, kind stranger.

The herbalist's lovely young wife was found disemboweled in her garden. The town's guards went around and asked all of the men without alibis who they thought committed the murder. \n\nIt was well-known that each of the men told exactly one lie. \n\nThe Tanner said that it (text-color:red)[wasn't] the Smith, and that it (text-color:green)[was] the Shepherd.\n\nThe Shepherd said that it (text-color:red)[wasn't] the Baker, and that it (text-color:red)[wasn't] the Smith.\n\nThe Baker said that it (text-color:green)[was] the Smith, and that it (text-color:red)[wasn't] the Tanner.\n\nThe Merchant said that it (text-color:green)[was] the Baker, and that it (text-color:green)[was] the Shepherd.\n\nThe Smith said that it (text-color:green)[was] the Merchant, and that it (text-color:red)[wasn't] the Tanner. \n\nThe town's mayor, seeking to be finally rid of the case, had the Merchant arrested, and the executioner hanged him in town square. \n\nDid the mayor kill the right man? Who was the woman's murderer?\"\n\n\n[[\"Yes, it was the Merchant.\"|kitsuneSorry1]]\n[[\"No, it was the Tanner.\"|kitsuneSorry2]]\n[[\"No, it was the Shepherd.\"|kitsuneSorry3]]\n[[\"No, it was the Baker.\"|kitsuneNextQuestion]]\n[[\"No, it was the Smith.\"|kitsuneSorry4]]\n\n",
