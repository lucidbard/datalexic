They arrived at night. They would not stay in any hotel, but set up a small camp at the United States headquarters inside the building, where delegations from the countries were already arriving. \n\n|diasguiente>[The next day] would be the first extraordinary meeting to discuss the alleged encounter with aliens, and almost all the countries that constitute the United Nations had confirmed the attendance of their highest leaders.\n\\(click: ?diasguiente )[{\n\t(show: ?prolama\u00f1ana )\n}]\n\n|prolama\u00f1ana)[In the morning, after sleeping on mattresses on the floor of the headquarters, the entire crisis cabinet got up before 7 a. m. in the morning. Partly because of the exciting situation they were going to be present during the day, and partly because $roy[Roy] had woken up $sangre[coughing and choking on his own blood] as he tried to breathe again.\n\nThe first plenary meeting of the day took place at 10 a. m., and the American committee of experts and scientists explained to the world the signals they had received and why these seemed to indicate imminent contact with an intelligent civilization in the coming days. \n\nSeveral technicians from the European Space Agency, directors of research centres of the most prestigious universities and people of recognized prestige in the world of science also appeared. All of them endorsed the possibility that the signs were real and, inspired by a decreasing mathematical series of time that accompanied all the signs, proclaimed the need to reach a worldwide consensus on how to act before this new race that was going to present itself before us.\n\nFrom the U. S. delegation room, $roy[Roy] and the entire team saw, as if it were a large carpet of dominoes falling on top of each other, the aliens they had created two days ago and how they began to be so real that it was sometimes difficult to come back to the truth and know they didn't exist. \n\n|iralatarde>[(Continue...)]\n\\]\n\\(click: ?iralatarde )[{\n\t(replace: ?iralatarde)[]\n\t(show: ?porlatarde )\n}]\n\\|porlatarde)[In the afternoon, a round of consultations began to find out the different opinions of the countries on the orientation of the relations that would be maintained in the first meetings. No one knew where the ship was going to land or what the country or countries chosen for such an important event would be. Whether they came to share technology and knowledge, take us as slaves, exploit our natural resources, study us like rats in a laboratory or just observe us from distance.\n\nEach country had a different viewpoint, although most of them were too ambiguous and did not want to be innocent or distrustful of a technologically much more advanced civilization. \n\nIt was decided late in the afternoon, before closing the round of consultations, to create action protocols so that, at the moment when the aliens come into contact with any of the countries present, there would be total transparency and communication with the rest, so that in the event of a threat, everyone could act as a single force. In this way, they also ensured that in the event of a peaceful visit, it was not only a nation that benefited from the technological exchange, breaking the current balance between the powerful and the developing countries.\n\n|iralanoche>[(Continue...)]\n\\]\n\\(click: ?iralanoche )[{\n\t(replace: ?iralanoche)[]\n\t(show: ?porlanoche )\n}]\n\\|porlanoche)[That night no one could sleep. The United Nations building was a hotbed. The leaders at all country headquarters were formulating and negotiating with their respective governments the rules of the future protocol that they were prepared to yield and those that they were not. \n\nHowever, in the room where $roy[Roy] was sitting, no one could sleep, but for another very different reason. Everyone knew that in a few hours a bomb would fall in Moscow without anyone knowing where it came from. It will not leave a visible trail, nor will it give anyone time to take refuge to save their lives. It will come from the sky, travel the distance from the Moon to Earth in less than a six and a half minutes and create a crater where there is now a city of people, families, stories, lifes.\n\n$al[\u2013 What's on your mind?] -said Al to Roy sitting next to him.\n\n$roy[\u2013 If this goes well, Al...

All countries met again to discuss the protocols of action that should be followed by the country that first came into contact with aliens. All of them brought briefcases and folders full of papers with their notes and proposals.\n\nThe debate was tough. Everyone wanted to introduce their clauses and objections. Countries were calling for an examination of aliens for possible parasites or bacteria harmful to the human race. Others wanted to capture them and keep the ship to use the technology they brought and explore the universe with it.

A few minutes later, a new one appeared: $italic[\"Communications cut off with Moscow by earthquake\"].\n\nAt that time, the president of Russia went out again and asked to appear publicly in front of the other states as a matter of urgency.
