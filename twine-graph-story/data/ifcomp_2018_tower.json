Straightaway the contrast is clear. While in the previous room there had been an unbridled explosion of colours, here the room restrains itself almost to the point of asceticism, filled with whiteness that spreads in all directions like ice on a freshly polished rink. It's bright not because of any light source in particular, but by dint of its sheer lack of dints. \n\nHanging from the ceiling, however, is a single rope, a part in the otherwise seamless clouds.

Yet, the curious sensation of sinking into the ground, combined with an explosion of aromas deeply evocative of Christmas, make you do a double take; almost at once, each of the infinitesimal niches in the walls reveals itself in stunning detail. It's as though the walls are sponges, saturated with pores and rufous and scents of the oven that are simultaneously absorbed and released. And what a smell. It is so refined in its sweetness, so overpowering in its warmth that it transports you to nowhere but the present, a gift you unwrap eagerly even before the <<linkreplace \"rest of the room\">><<include \"Line Cake\">><<scrolldown>><</linkreplace>> presents itself to you.",

      "text": "<<set $password to $password.toLowerCase()>><<if $password is \"eiffel\" and $game is 1>> The tower is a tower of life, consisting of rooms that are also miniature towers by themselves. Each of these rooms represents a type of day in a year:\n\n\u265a Castle represents days of control\n\u25d4 Cake represents days of indulgence\n\u224b Lighthouse represents days of isolation\n\u262f Pagoda represents days of zen\n\u265e Chess piece represents days of restlessness\n\u25b2 Top floor represents the birthday\n\nFor example, the element of control is demonstrated in the castle through the (relatively) more complex series of steps that had to be performed to clear the stage.\n\nAs the protagonist goes through each room, i.e. each of the various types of days, and returns to the starting point, it is as though he starts and completes one cycle, i.e. one year. This is marked by the protagonist then making a journey to the top floor, i.e. passing his birthday. The top floor is also where the names of every other tower are reiterated as a form of reflection, as though to summarise the events of that year.\n\nWhile the rooms only make reference to one another from the point of view of the protagonist, the order in which they are arranged is not arbitrary. The lighthouse is placed towards the end to suggest a form of withdrawal as the year draws to a close and we enter a state of pensiveness. The pagoda is placed right in the middle to represent a moment of zen in the midst of conflict and unpredictability. The hotel, where the protagonist starts, is demonstrated to be the most hospitable of all the towers, which parallels how the period just before the start of a new year is when we feel most at home, secure in the knowledge that everything up to that point in our lives can only be as frightening as our memory and imagination permit. Yet, just like how a hotel only provides temporary lodging, we must move on to the new year eventually.\n\nRelated to this, of course, is the game's secondary but no less important purpose of exploring the concept of towers. Only details are given: the definition of citadel, which doesn't explain towers directly; the hidden tower in each room, which insinuates, very subtly, that towers are tall; the multitude of examples throughout the rest of the game, all without answers. In fact, the word 'tower' is mentioned just three times: once at the start, once before the pagoda, and once at the very end. There is thus some sort of closure, as though to say, this is all the game has to offer. As to what towers really are, it is up to readers to come to their own conclusion.\n\nTower is also intended as a symbol of optimism, as the <span class=\"redlink\">[[blurb->Blurb]]</span> hints at. Themes of moving on are seen in the ascent itself, and the protagonist ultimately manages to survive the fire because he realises the value in learning from the very experience that caused him so much trauma (or through sheer luck, which is always a possibility).

Since most in my vicinity didn't suffer from the same dissatisfaction, I assumed it was just me and left it at that. It was only years later that I noticed something strange: the restrictions. They seemed harmless at first glance, as I had concluded to myself back then. Now, however, I realised they couldn't have been better disguised as wolves in sheep's clothing, designed to the extent that one would obey them without much delay even as they asserted their control. What's more, they were everywhere. No leading of vagrant lives; no usage of loudspeakers near the cemeteries. No conversations with anyone in confinement. It began to dawn on me that the officials were hiding something, and that this something was widespread in the past. Ironically, as I entered the future, the vision of an expedition to see for myself seemed less and less far away. One day I awoke with doubts, the next I had made up my mind.\n\n\"And so I started plotting. Every night, if I wasn't twisting away with my wrench, I would be breaking into appliance shops to dismantle ovens and blenders for spare parts, taking so little that to the average consumer no change in performance would be noticeable. This I confirmed with regular visits to the shops during the day, when I pretended to study the displays in great detail whilst really listening for angry customers barging in to complain about the drop in quality, the possibility of which I was paranoid about. There were none, and I soon began to relax, taking fewer and fewer daylight trips until finally, I stopped going altogether. Months passed. My machine grew steadily. No one noticed my progress, though I once had a close call in which a friend visited without informing me beforehand, apparently intending to invite me to the bar. As I accepted, turning to get my keys, he suddenly enquired about the machine. I was so caught off guard that I nearly stumbled. Somehow I kept my balance, and managed to maintain an artificial calm in my voice as I explained that it was a clothes dryer. But I knew it looked nothing like one, even in its incomplete state, and though I had my back turned, I could almost feel the disbelief on his face. Fortunately, he didn't say anything, or, for that matter, return to the topic for the rest of our trip. \n\n\"The night I expected it to be completed, I carried the three-foot device with me, yet chose to take a longer route than usual to the appliance shop, wanting to find inspiration as to where I could set up the machine along the way. That was, at least, what I told myself, though the precise reason was equally unclear. Perhaps I wanted to view, for the last time, the city I was about to leave. This would be for practical reasons, of course, as I wouldn't have wanted to get lost in the past. But undeniably, it was also for the moonlit boulevards I would never get to see again. \n\n\"That was when I discovered the mausoleum. It was so concealed that in my half-asleep state, it was a wonder that I noticed it at all, though exist it definitely did. I was deathly curious as to what lay within, but because of the delay in walking time I knew I wouldn't be able to explore it, not unless I had an opportunity much later. So I quickened my footsteps, hoping to return soon.\n\n\"By this time I'd been so familiar with the layout of the appliance shop that I could have gone in with a hand tied behind my back and both eyes closed. I might as well have been, however, as my mind was wholly occupied with my recent discovery, so much so that after a few minutes I realised I'd been standing there with what I needed in hand, apparently having completed the task without the assistance of my brain. But exhaustion aside, the room seemed darker than usual. I turned to leave, and there stood the group of officials, along with the person whom I had once called my friend. I didn't blink. My eyes merely travelled up to his, and it was as if they spoke out loud, the voice of a drunkard, monotonous and unapologetic, saying that my machine couldn't have been visible from the door. That the visit all those weeks ago had been no visit at all. \n\n\"So it would appear that my past had caught up with me. But far from wanting to get away from it, I needed to look for it, to find a solution that I had hidden at the back of my head. There it was: the memory of my early morning visit to the shop when I'd had to shield my eyes from the ceiling, from which protruded stalactites of illumination. The effect, I knew, would only be compounded at night. I was right.\n\n\"I took a leap of faith, hugging the pile of cogs and gears in my arms, heading straight towards the mausoleum, all the while expecting to trip, or to drop something, or to forget the way. For all I knew, the mausoleum might not even have existed. But there was nothing of the sort. My legs simply propelled themselves, and by the same sense of foresight I knew the gates would be open for me. By the time the magic stopped, I was in front of the portal, needing only to take a single step to success. Yet I found it impossible. All of a sudden, everything I'd believed in before seemed a fool's dream. Even the ever-increasing pressure created by the pounding door wasn't enough; in fact, it put pressure on me in the opposite direction, compelling me to accept my fate and move on. But then, in the midst of stepping backwards, I realised it wasn't my ideas that were wrong. It was me. The magic hadn't stopped. The mausoleum hadn't abandoned me. It had left something for my eyes, a message of just three words. <i>Revere the past.</i>\n\n\"I had revered that of the ancients. So I began to revere my own.\"\n\n\n<span class=\"redlink\">[[Back->Code]]</span>\n\n<<else>> Invalid code.

The influence of a clear head, however, which fear had previously disrupted, leads you to see the fruit for what it currently is \u2014 a heavy burden, and little more. Dazzling as it is, you can't see yourself lugging this four-pound peacock just for the sake of admiring its hide. Besides, you're in no particular need of food, especially after that gut-churning experience, and in any case, there's always cake available downstairs. There seems no reason why you shouldn't leave the watermelon here and return to this room when melon-cholic desire strikes.\n\n\n<span class=\"redlink\">[[Climb the stairs to the next room->In Between]]</span>",

But your eyes hadn't played any tricks whilst you were scanning for another way across \u2014 the room is unequivocally empty. There's not a speck of dust on the ground, much less any metal contraption that could pass off as a key. Your dismay is only reinforced when you think about the multitude of stairs you need to climb with this burden on hand, just for a chance at a reward that might, in all likelihood, be next to nothing. With these thoughts in mind, you arrive at the conclusion that leaving the chest here and returning to this room upon finding a key would probably be the best way to go.\n\n\n<span class=\"redlink\">[[Climb the stairs to the next room->In Between]]</span>",

Eagerly you set about examining the objects, only to experience trouble prying them apart; apparently, the watermelon has attached so well to the treasure chest that effort is needed to separate the two. Upon doing so, you notice something you hadn't seen before in the concavity of the chest: a small white cross, purposefully marked. X, like on a treasure map. X marks the spot.\n\nYour eyes fall on the watermelon. <<linkreplace \"It's worth a shot.\">><<include \"Line Both 2 1\">><</linkreplace>>",

Unfortunately, this takes a while, and so does individually turning the spigots on, which dispense beer as if it were honey, each drop appearing to fall in slow motion. By the time the moat is full, the only movement is that of the waterwheel. <<linkappend \"The fish have died.\">>\n\nThere isn't time to mourn the loss, though. The flow of beer into the moat is and was the only thing keeping the waterwheel moving, and the last few drops are approaching; indeed, the portcullis, as though displeased with its dwindling offerings, has already begun its descent. Having little choice, you wade through the moat and make it through the exit with a comfortable distance between the spikes and your head.\n\n\n<span class=\"redlink\">[[Proceed->Between Cont]]</span><</linkappend>>",

Even your position behind the cannon is not spared \u2014 beer sloshes over you as though you were at a food fight. But examining the damage, including that on yourself, is impossible, because the room has gone dark. Evidently, the beer hadn't missed the torches, either.\n\nThe whirring of the waterwheel, along with the creaking of the portcullis as it is lifted off the ground, reassure you that the moat is full.
