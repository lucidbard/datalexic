The sun is rising far away on some horizon you cannot see through the trees. Birdsong is yet another reminder that you often sleep outdoors like this. A carpet of moss below you served as a more generous cushion than the rocks you usually sleep on.\n\nYou are a gnoll. You have not forgotten, nor have you just remembered. Your name is Sniff Chewpaw, a name given to you by the Spotmother. You have patchy dun fur with blackbrown spots, and a mane of greased black running down your neck and back. Sometimes, humans tell you that you look like a hyena. \n\nYou have never seen a hyena.\n\nFor twelve summers you lived amongst other gnolls, learning the ways of sweat and battle. For three summers you lived free, a tribe runaway. It is the end of your third summer alone. You have traveled two days time from the Black River, and for good reason. There is a client waiting in a cavern told to be within the mountain on which this forest grows. The trees are old, but the mountain is much older.\n\nYou have your knapsack beside you, filled with what a stable sweeper would generously refer to as 'garbage.' In fact, you had been resting your head upon it until now. The clothes on your back, made of bark, twine, and scavenged metal, are your only other possession. Money has been tight, and the last drachs you received were shaved more than a barbarian's chest.\n\nYou don't know the exact location of your client, but you do what you do best.\n\nYou sniff.\n\n[[Sniff.->HeSniff]]</div>",

Thanks to it, you have spent just as many sleepless nights half-choking on the scent of a wretchspore ten miles away as you have located the subjects of your investigations. Your nose, while a powerful tool, cuts both ways.\n\nThis time, you smell a bit of sulfer and soot. Ash. It leads you north. The pines spindle upwards around you to dizzying heights, and occasionally your paw catches on an upturned root or the shell of a dead tree. You give a wide berth to the runes you see inscribed sharply on stones. Before long, the ground turns up at an angle, and the dirt and moss becomes slabs and boulders. Your knees ache at the steep hike. It's all you can do to follow your nose toward a dip, surrounded by rocks, that leads to a clearing and a crumbly cliff face.\n\nThe telltale leaves of wainrot roots grow all around the mouth of the cave. They're rare, but also very poisonous. It's said dwarves can drink them, but only after they've been refined into a cordial.\n\nAhead lies the cave opening. It yawns like a cat; rock growths tapering to sharp points hang above and rise from below. You never can remember what they're called.\n\n[[Enter cave.->Cave]]</div>",

The passageway tightens so that you have to flatten yourself against the diagonal walls to squeeze through an opening just small enough for you.\n\nAfter you pull your left foot paw out of the jagged shape of the opening, you turn to see the cave spread wide, high and domed all around. An odd feeling comes over you as you examine the furthest edges of the chamber, which disappear into darkness. With one more step forward, a hot gust of air tousles your mane and nearly blows you backward. It was the exhale of a creature with sulphuric breath.

Using both paws, you feel along the wall, inching deeper into the cave. As you progress, the opening seems to shrink, and soon you can reach with another paw and touch another wall of stone on your opposite side.\n\nCarefully, you move your paws inward, feeling a void in the rock, large enough to fit your body through if only barely.

Even just a brief glance reveals dapping blocks, anvils and scales in great supply and of varying size. Rings of gauges hang off racks, some gauges large enough for the fingers of non-humanoid creatures - or large enough for you stick your head through. Numerous other pieces of equipment are haphazardly stacked across the tables, and you aren't quite sure of their names.\n\nThe room is, at least, well lit by glowing orbs of glass attached to the walls. Those, and a bubbling cauldron in one corner of the room filled with liquid metal the color of the sun.\n(if: $accepthelp is 1)[\nElazabelle clucks her tongue. \"Now I see why Hargurrath was so upset.

After striking it gently on the surface of the table, it bursts into flame about the bulb, throwing the dining room into a dim orange light.\n\nThe table is adorned with some sort of foul carving, done with a dagger or some other pointed object, depicting what would be best not described to the young, the austere, the squeamish, the prudish, or the modest and generally most perturbed by artistic depictions of elaborately vulgar insults.\n\nSome text sits next to it, but you can't read. \n\nRotha, however, can. She snorts and grits her teeth and throws a clawkerchief over the carving.\n\nI promise, not part of table! The thieves, vandals too, carve this here.\"\n\n\"What say, Rotha?\"\n\nRotha tries to see over the table, but she can't quite make it.
