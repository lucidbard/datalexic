Teamwork makes the dream work, you know?\n\t\n\tAh, but it seems we have written ourselves into a corner now. We have the obvious next course of action: you walking through the door, seeing the vial of cure, and picking it up. And then, you go back the way you came and find a way to send it to your loved one in need. That seems all quite linear though. I guess there could be a few choices on what method you choose to send the vial. I\u2019m not feeling inspired by. I was really interested in the whole \u201ceveryone suddenly disappears\u201d plot that we had going on before, but I feel like we\u2019re so off track that there isn\u2019t a seamless way to reconnect with that.\n\t\n\tWhat if, stay with me now, what if we changed genres? I cannot think of a way to make this ending interesting with our current genre, but if we changed it up a bit, we might have something. How about an old detective story, like a noir? Yes, that\u2019s it! You, now with the cure in hand, travel across the country to deliver the cure to Haggard, only to find him dead. Now that\u2019s a story. How about it, are you willing to embrace such a strong story change? \n\t\n[[You grab your nearest fedora and become a crime sleuth.|Noir Good Times]]\n[[You reject the concept of changing genres so late in the story.

What if there is a trap behind the left door? No, we can do this the better way. Logic and reasoning.\n\t\n\tLet's start our calculations with the door on the left.

Yes, but it wouldn't mean that the left door was right.
