It was impossible to get a clear view past the full-size eucalyptus trees inside, not to mention the masses of man-sized pipes and columns linking every part of the Great Exhibition to every other part.\n(set: $brass to 2)\nThe building was so enormous it had its own weather patterns, and there were ornithopters and gliders cluttering the air. The structure was so delicate it looked to my eye as if a smart saboteur could destroy it with minimal effort. \n\nAnd then it wasn't. The thrumming engines had a distinct rhythm, and after a while I could see where the main beats were coming from: The automatic reaping engine vibrated at a frequency that moved in waves through the building every few minutes, and there was a herd of segmented tin horses that jerked along in a full loop around the central fountain over and over again. Even the ornithopters took flight as one flock before floating to the ground and getting hauled back up on pulleys for a new set of amateur aeronauts to try.\n\nThe people followed the same swirling pattern, instinctively circling clockwise. They were densely packed, making themselves vulnerable to crushed skirts, pickpockets, and fires. \n\nThe members of the security team walked against the flow, scanning faces and ignoring exhibits. If we moved with them they would be far less likely to see us. We could also take advantage of exhibits with a central item that shielded customers from easy view.\n\nI watched from above as Mr Lalor's security team gathered in a sheltered alcove, talking intently to one another.\n\n[[Spy on them.->Scene 2.3a]]\n\n[[Confront them.->Scene 2.3b]]\n\n[[Avoid them.->Scene 2.3c]]</span><span id=\"box\">[[''Magic & Skills''->Magical Metals]]\n\n(if: $tin > 0)[//Tin = Popularity//](if: $tin < 1)[Tin = Popularity]\n(if: $lead > 0)[//Lead = Empathy//](if: $lead < 1)[Lead = Empathy]\n(if: $brass > 0)[//Brass = Physiology//](if: $brass < 1)[Brass = Physiology]\n(if: $iron > 0)[//Iron = Strength//](if: $iron < 1)[Iron = Strength]\n(if: $silver > 0)[//Silver = Know-how//](if: $silver < 1)[Silver = Know-How]\n(if: $gold > 0)[//Gold = Charm//](if: $gold < 1)[Gold = Charm]\n(if: $aluminium > 0)[//Aluminium = Grace//](if: $aluminium < 1)[Aluminium = Grace]\n\n<img src=\"https://felicitybanks.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_0872.jpg?w=500\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" alt=\"img_0872.jpg\">\n\n(link-goto: \"Back\", (history:)'s last) \n</span>",

Inside the large iron shaft there was a concealed knife, a spring-loaded packet of flechettes, and a grappling hook.\n\nI wanted it. Not knowing how to acquire one of the prototypes on display, I stood staring at it until one of the inventors noticed me and said quietly, \"You're one of the lot wanting independence for Victoria, aren't you?\"\n\nThe activated tin I wore parped delightedly, and since I didn't have a choice I nodded confession.\n\n\"Keep it,\" she said, and pushed it into my hand before gently shoving me back into the throng of people.

Everyone in the Exhibition had come to admire the brilliance of Australia's creators, and now one of the most magnificent and useful creations was about to chew them to bits like so much dumb stone.\n(set: $lead to 2)\nThe inventor herself stood within the informal confines of her display, frozen with horror. Her skirts were not quite long enough, and still were still augmented with the crinoline wheels that had long since fallen out of fashion. Even among inventors, she was underfunded.\n\nUnderfunded meant only having one prototype; bringing the wheeled version into the Great Exhibition instead of building a second model specifically for public display in a confined space. Underfunded meant layers and layers of fear: Being ejected from Society on a whim; being imprisoned for an innocent mistake; being laughed at; destroying her machine and her life with it. The fear of becoming an accidental murderess was buried among the rest. \n\n<img src=\"https://felicitybanks.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-23-at-5-14-54-pm.png?w=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\" alt=\"screen-shot-2016-09-23-at-5-14-54-pm\">\n\nShe was brilliant, but not when she was full of fear.\n\nI spotted her name on a hand-stencilled sign half-hidden in the shadows at the back of her display area, and I knew exactly what to say to snap her out of her frozen terror.\n\n\"Ms Sarah Xiniwe!\" I shouted, and her chin jerked upwards as I pointed to her rogue machine. \"It is beautiful!\"\n\nHer mouth dropped open in simple shock, and then her eyes cleared and she gathered her skirts and leaped aboard her machine, hauling on a lever and unwinding a gear-chain until it suddenly came to a stop.\n\n\"Magnificent display!\" I yelled into the sudden silence, and the crowd gasped in delight and cheered her.\n\nShe met my eye, and gave a slight wave of acknowledgement.

The ground floor wasn't so very far away, and copper wasn't as hard as iron. I just needed to slow my fall a little.\n\nThe silk made a shushing noise as I pulled it off the unattended engine, and the owner shouted in anger and ran my way.\n\nI threw the sheet of silk over the exposed steam valve where my favourite engine would normally feed power to its wheels. Here in the Great Exhibition, it had to remain stationary.\n\nThe silk puffed out at once, catching and holding the steam. I saw the steam already condensing inside its silk bubble, but held my nerve and hoped for the best.\n\nWhen my improvised balloon felt ready to tug itself out of my hands I drew the corners together into a mass of silk and ran with it to the balcony, hurling myself balloon-first into the air.\n\nFor a moment, the muscles in my arms strained as the force of gravity lost its fight against my steam-filled balloon. Then scalding water ran down my hands, and the balloon quickly lost what little steam it had managed to contain.\n\nI fell.\n(if: $aluminium > 0)[\nMy knees and back and ankles shrieked as I landed on the metal floor, but I lived! I was alive, and unharmed, and the crowd cheered at the supposed show.\n(if: $aluminium < 2)[\nThank goodness for the weight-neutralising magic of aluminium! ]](if: $aluminium < 1)[\nMy knees and back and ankles crumpled as I landed on the metal floor, and for a moment I lay stunned.

Once I'd made a full report, we were ready for our next challenge.\n(if: $scene2 < 1)[\n[[Training Montage<-\"We need a training montage!\"]]]\n(if: $scene3 < 1)[\n[[\"Do you hear something?\"->Do you hear something??]]]\n\n[[Her Royal Majesty<-\"Queen Victoria is about to arrive!\"]]</span><span id=\"box\">[[''Magic & Skills''->Magical Metals]]\n\n(if: $tin > 0)[//Tin = Popularity//](if: $tin < 1)[Tin = Popularity]\n(if: $lead > 0)[//Lead = Empathy//](if: $lead < 1)[Lead = Empathy]\n(if: $brass > 0)[//Brass = Physiology//](if: $brass < 1)[Brass = Physiology]\n(if: $iron > 0)[//Iron = Strength//](if: $iron < 1)[Iron = Strength]\n(if: $silver > 0)[//Silver = Know-how//](if: $silver < 1)[Silver = Know-How]\n(if: $gold > 0)[//Gold = Charm//](if: $gold < 1)[Gold = Charm]\n(if: $aluminium > 0)[//Aluminium = Grace//](if: $aluminium < 1)[Aluminium = Grace]\n\n<img src=\"https://felicitybanks.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_0872.jpg?w=500\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" alt=\"img_0872.jpg\">\n\n(link-goto: \"Back\", (history:)'s last) \n</span>",

It filled the air with swooping elegance and the glorious power of the horns.\n\nHer Royal Majesty was coming.\n\nI stood on a balcony and watched from above as she walked inside, preceded and flanked by her attendants. She was smaller than I expected, and looked older than her forty-odd years. As I watched, she waved to the crowd of onlookers, turning her head to take us all in.\n\nWhen she lifted her eyes to the balconies, I felt as if she was looking directly at me. The steadiness of that gaze made her seem ancient; timeless rather than old.\n\n<img src=\"https://felicitybanks.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-10-48-30-am.png?w=1000\" width=\"500\" height=\"700\" alt=\"screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-10-48-30-am.png\">\n\nThere was something in her dark hair.

I stepped back instinctively, realising too late that I'd given away my guilt. Her husband followed her gaze, and stiffened in fury.\n\n\"There!\" she said, shaking her arm to temporarily dislodge some dozen or more spiders. Unfortunately for us, she had quickly realised the spiders were no more than a nuisance. \"Guards!\"\n\nIn seconds, there were people running towards me up and down stairs and even through the copper corridors that I'd hoped would assist me in making good my escape.\n\nThe day was technically a success, in that Her Royal Majesty's security team had failed to stop our attack on her dignity.

Her blood wet my hair, and I grabbed her wrist and twisted until her weapon fell to the ground.\n\nAnd fired.\n\nThe crowd gasped as one, and in that huge intake of breath the smash and creak of broken, twisting metal stood out as the warning it was.\n\nNecks craned upwards, seeing the thin heights of the central column begin to collapse from its highest, thinnest point.\n\nA single pane of glass from the copper-checkered ceiling slipped from its place and fell, smashing to bits in the fountain. None of the roof's glass and copper squares were secured! They held each other upright in a perfect geodesic pattern... and the pattern was broken.\n\nThe Great Exhibition was going to fall!

Mechanical limbs? Labor-saving contraptions that were quite obviously both deadly and insane? Escaped criminals raising an army to gain independence from Britain? Aboriginal people adopting bushrangers into their nation? Political activists transported as convicts to Australia? Wealthy immigrants? Female inventors? Bizarre and beautiful buildings with fatal flaws? Well-known lesbian couples? Women dressed as men? Men dressed as women? Escaped convicts re-entering society as respected citizens? The 1854 battle between corrupt British forces and a multicultural mix of gold miners? Queen Victoria's epic romance with her handsome and technology-obsessed German consort? Charles Dickens's fascination with Australia? Peter Lalor's missing arm, and his abrupt change from democratic rebel to wealthy and conservative politician?\n\nAll real.\n\n''Cover Art:''\nPhotographer: Jody Cherry (<a href='http://www.facebook.com/Exp0sureStudi0s' target='_blank'>''Exposure Studios''</a>)\nHair & Make-up: Jody Cherry (Cherrish Hair & Make-up Artistry)\nModel: Amelia Brown\nCropped square and text added: Felicity Banks\n\nThe clockwork spider featured in the sidebar was built by Justin Gershenson-Gates at ''A Mechanical Mind''.\n<a href='https://www.facebook.com/amechanicalmind/'_blank'>Facebook</a> and <a href='https://www.etsy.com/shop/amechanicalmind/'_blank'>Etsy</a>\n\nPocketwatch image: Felicity Banks\n\nRoller Skate images: <a href='http://www.wikipedia.org' target='_blank'>Wikipedia</a>\n\nPeter Lalor image: <a href='http://ergo.slv.vic.gov.au/explore-history/rebels-outlaws/' target='_blank'>State Library of Victoria</a>\n\nPrince Albert image: <a href='https://www.royalcollection.org.uk' target='_blank'>Royal Collection Trust</a>\n\nAll other images are historical pictures from <a href='http://www.bmimages.com/index.asp' target='_blank'>The British Museum</a> or <a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary' target='_blank'>The British Library</a>.\n\n[[Return-> ]]",

      "text": "1. ''Choices: And Their Souls Were Eaten:'' An interactive serial story set in 1838 Europe, released on <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.tinmangames.choices&hl=en' target='_blank'>Google Play</a> or <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/choices-and-the-sun-went-out/id1004909104?mt=8'>the app store</a> by Tin Man Games during 2016-2017. I like to pretend the player character is Emmeline\u2019s relative. \nSpoiler danger: Low. The magic system is evolving in this story, so some discoveries are old news to readers of the other stories. This is 100% safe to read.\n\n2.  ''Heart of Brass:'' A young adult steampunk novel set mainly in 1854 Australia. Available in print or digital formats throughout the world via <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Heart-Brass-Antipodean-Queen-Book-ebook/dp/B01J58E7RE/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1474853953&sr=8-3&keywords=heart+of+brass' target='_blank'>Amazon</a> or <a href='http://odysseybooks.com.au/titles/9781922200587/' target='_blank'>Odyssey Books</a>.\nSpoiler danger: Low. This is Emmeline's origin story (and the origin story of many others), and is 100% safe to read.\nIt's likely the novel will eventually become a trilogy entitled //The Antipodean Queen Series//.\n\n3. ''After the Flag Fell:'' A printable interactive story that won the 2015 Windhammer Prize. That version is free <a href='http://www.arborell.com/aftertheflagfell.pdf'target='_blank'>here</a>, and an updated version is included with all editions of Heart of Brass. //After the Flag Fell// is set in 1854 Australia, and the player character is the historical figure Peter Lalor.\nSpoiler danger: High. The story takes place immediately after the climax of //Heart of Brass//.\n\n4. ''Stuff and Nonsense:'' A free interactive Twine game set in Australia in 1860. \nSpoiler danger: Medium. The characters of Emmeline, Patrick, and Matilda have changed since the beginning of //Heart of Brass//. \n\n5. ''Attack of the Clockwork Army:'' An interactive ChoiceScript story that takes place in the 1860s, mainly in Australia. It allows you to play as one of Emmeline\u2019s siblings if you wish, or as an original character in a slightly different and spoiler-minimised reality. Available <a href='https://www.choiceofgames.com/user-contributed/attack-of-the-clockwork-army/#utm_medium=web&utm_source=ourgames'>here</a> as an app for any device, or it can be read on your browser.\nSpoiler danger: High. The characters of Emmeline, Patrick, and Matilda have changed since the beginning of //Heart of Brass//, and although it's possible to play in an alternate reality there is at least one medium-level revelation that remains obvious. \n\nEach story stands independent of the rest. You can read one, several, or all of them.\n\nIf you want to know about new releases and/or public appearances (restricted to Australia at present, and usually ACT/NSW), email fellissimo@hotmail.com with the subject line \"Mailing List\".\n\n[[Return to title page-> ]]",

For that, you are granted mercy... once.\" \n\n\"Thank you, Your Royal Majesty,\" said Emmeline.\n\nPrince Albert escorted me inside to witness Emmeline's beating at the hands of a pair of footmen who took it in turns to hit her with springy birch branches torn from the trees outside. Emmeline wept, clinging to the pavilion's central column for support, but she didn't let herself cry out.\n\n\"Now get out of my sight,\" said the prince, and retired to tend to his queen.\n\nEmmeline and I left the area with uncommon rapidity, expecting to be called back at any moment. She leant heavily on me, trying and failing to hide her pain.\n\nPatrick and Matilda spotted us and ran to support Emmeline. \"Don't worry,\" said Matilda. \"Doctor Normal's bought us a carriage to get out of here. You won't need to walk for long.\"\n\nWhen we were thoroughly lost in the remaining crowd, we turned back to watch the queen's entourage pack up her tent and drive off in a long string of decorated carriages. We had defied Her Royal Majesty, and survived.\n\nThe story was far from over.\n\nTHE END\n\n<img src=\"https://felicitybanks.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-11-28-09-pm.png?w=500\" width=\"350\" height=\"320\" alt=\"screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-11-28-09-pm.png\">\n\n[[Return to the beginning-> ]], or to [[Queen Victoria's entrance->\"What is the meaning of this!\"]], or visit the [[Exhibits]] or the [[Credits & Notes]]. \n\n[[Detailed Walkthrough & Mechanics]]\n</span><span id=\"box\">[[''Magic & Skills''->Magical Metals]]\n\n(if: $tin > 0)[//Tin = Popularity//](if: $tin < 1)[Tin = Popularity]\n(if: $lead > 0)[//Lead = Empathy//](if: $lead < 1)[Lead = Empathy]\n(if: $brass > 0)[//Brass = Physiology//](if: $brass < 1)[Brass = Physiology]\n(if: $iron > 0)[//Iron = Strength//](if: $iron < 1)[Iron = Strength]\n(if: $silver > 0)[//Silver = Know-how//](if: $silver < 1)[Silver = Know-How]\n(if: $gold > 0)[//Gold = Charm//](if: $gold < 1)[Gold = Charm]\n(if: $aluminium > 0)[//Aluminium = Grace//](if: $aluminium < 1)[Aluminium = Grace]\n\n<img src=\"https://felicitybanks.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_0870.jpg?w=500\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" alt=\"img_0870.jpg\">\n\n(link-goto: \"Back\", (history:)'s last) \n</span>",

We had set out to humiliate Queen Victoria and popularise our own cause, and we'd caused a ruckus that could have killed thousands of innocent people. Her Royal Majesty had saved them. \n\nPrince Albert escorted me inside and Mr Lalor attached heavy iron chains to my legs. Emmeline was already weighted down with her own shackles, pale with terror and grief. \n\nThe royal couple left, and the pavilion was disassembled around us. Soon we stood exposed to the jeers and spitting of the crowd. Mr Lalor, Mr Dickens, and the lady mechanic shielded us from the crowd as well as they could while they escorted us to a carriage set aside to transport us to Bearbrass Gaol. \n\nI should have scampered when I had the chance.\n\nAs we climbed the steps I glimpsed Patrick and Matilda in the crowd, hurrying away from us. When I stepped inside, someone entered the opposite door and threw an enormous hessian sack over my head. They grabbed my waist and yanked me from the carriage with magic-enhanced strength. \n\n\"Emmeline!\" I squeaked.\n\n\"It's me,\" Matilda hissed through the loose weave. \"Shut your sauce-box.\"\n\nI heard Patrick whispering to Emmeline, and the answering clank of her chains\u2014then the whinny of a nearby horse. Matilda gave me a good hard shake, sending me and my irons to the bottom of the sack, where one of my new ankle bracelets smashed into my forehead.\n\nMatilda and Patrick threw Emmeline and I over the horse's back like so much scrap metal, and led the horse away. I heard distant shouts as our escape was discovered, but we got away. For the moment. \n\nEmmeline had turned me into a wanted criminal. I needed to have a long, hard think about whether I should continue to follow her.\n\nTHE END\n\n<img src=\"https://felicitybanks.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-11-28-09-pm.png?w=500\" width=\"350\" height=\"320\" alt=\"screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-11-28-09-pm.png\">\n\n[[Return to the beginning-> ]], or to [[Queen Victoria's entrance->\"What is the meaning of this!\"]], or visit the [[Exhibits]] or the [[Credits & Notes]]. \n\n[[Detailed Walkthrough & Mechanics]]\n</span><span id=\"box\">[[''Magic & Skills''->Magical Metals]]\n\n(if: $tin > 0)[//Tin = Popularity//](if: $tin < 1)[Tin = Popularity]\n(if: $lead > 0)[//Lead = Empathy//](if: $lead < 1)[Lead = Empathy]\n(if: $brass > 0)[//Brass = Physiology//](if: $brass < 1)[Brass = Physiology]\n(if: $iron > 0)[//Iron = Strength//](if: $iron < 1)[Iron = Strength]\n(if: $silver > 0)[//Silver = Know-how//](if: $silver < 1)[Silver = Know-How]\n(if: $gold > 0)[//Gold = Charm//](if: $gold < 1)[Gold = Charm]\n(if: $aluminium > 0)[//Aluminium = Grace//](if: $aluminium < 1)[Aluminium = Grace]\n\n<img src=\"https://felicitybanks.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_0870.jpg?w=500\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" alt=\"img_0870.jpg\">\n\n(link-goto: \"Back\", (history:)'s last) \n</span>",

He glanced up the hill, wondering where his master might be, and how severely he'd be punished. Then he took my bag of gold and activated aluminium, and made ready the horses.\n\nPatrick and Matilda walked along the road looking for me, leading Emmeline and Samir. Emmeline was pale and limping, and the back of her dress was soaked with her blood. But she was free.\n\nWe loaded up the carriage, drew the shutters, and left the crowd and queen behind.\n\nWhen we were safely on our way I looked back to watch the queen's entourage drive off in a long string of decorated carriages. We had defied Her Royal Majesty, and survived.\n\nThe story was far from over.\n\nTHE END\n\n<img src=\"https://felicitybanks.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-11-28-09-pm.png?w=500\" width=\"350\" height=\"320\" alt=\"screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-11-28-09-pm.png\">\n\n[[Return to the beginning-> ]], or to [[Queen Victoria's entrance->\"What is the meaning of this!\"]], or visit the [[Exhibits]] or the [[Credits & Notes]]. \n\n[[Detailed Walkthrough & Mechanics]]\n</span><span id=\"box\">[[''Magic & Skills''->Magical Metals]]\n\n(if: $tin > 0)[//Tin = Popularity//](if: $tin < 1)[Tin = Popularity]\n(if: $lead > 0)[//Lead = Empathy//](if: $lead < 1)[Lead = Empathy]\n(if: $brass > 0)[//Brass = Physiology//](if: $brass < 1)[Brass = Physiology]\n(if: $iron > 0)[//Iron = Strength//](if: $iron < 1)[Iron = Strength]\n(if: $silver > 0)[//Silver = Know-how//](if: $silver < 1)[Silver = Know-How]\n(if: $gold > 0)[//Gold = Charm//](if: $gold < 1)[Gold = Charm]\n(if: $aluminium > 0)[//Aluminium = Grace//](if: $aluminium < 1)[Aluminium = Grace]\n\n<img src=\"https://felicitybanks.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_0870.jpg?w=500\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" alt=\"img_0870.jpg\">\n\n(link-goto: \"Back\", (history:)'s last) \n</span>",

They were alone.\n\nEmmeline was pale and limping, and the back of her dress was soaked with her blood. She'd been beaten. But she was free.\n\nWe gathered them up and Patrick's new horse carried them away from the horror of the broken exhibition. No-one had lost their life. Not this time.\n\nWhen we were safely on our way I looked back to watch the queen's entourage drive off in a long string of decorated carriages. We had defied Her Royal Majesty, and survived.\n\nThe story was far from over.\n\nTHE END\n\n<img src=\"https://felicitybanks.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-11-28-09-pm.png?w=500\" width=\"350\" height=\"320\" alt=\"screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-11-28-09-pm.png\">\n\n[[Return to the beginning-> ]], or to [[Queen Victoria's entrance->\"What is the meaning of this!\"]], or visit the [[Exhibits]] or the [[Credits & Notes]]. \n\n[[Detailed Walkthrough & Mechanics]]\n</span><span id=\"box\">[[''Magic & Skills''->Magical Metals]]\n\n(if: $tin > 0)[//Tin = Popularity//](if: $tin < 1)[Tin = Popularity]\n(if: $lead > 0)[//Lead = Empathy//](if: $lead < 1)[Lead = Empathy]\n(if: $brass > 0)[//Brass = Physiology//](if: $brass < 1)[Brass = Physiology]\n(if: $iron > 0)[//Iron = Strength//](if: $iron < 1)[Iron = Strength]\n(if: $silver > 0)[//Silver = Know-how//](if: $silver < 1)[Silver = Know-How]\n(if: $gold > 0)[//Gold = Charm//](if: $gold < 1)[Gold = Charm]\n(if: $aluminium > 0)[//Aluminium = Grace//](if: $aluminium < 1)[Aluminium = Grace]\n\n<img src=\"https://felicitybanks.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_0870.jpg?w=500\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" alt=\"img_0870.jpg\">\n\n(link-goto: \"Back\", (history:)'s last) \n</span>",

I'll arrange a carriage.\"\n\n\"She's dead,\" I said aloud. The words sounded as if they came from somewhere else. \n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Doctor Normal. \"All of Bearbrass is in an uproar. This is the perfect time for your kind of mischief.\"\n\nHe was right. \n\nPatrick and I left him, and I scanned the line of carriages on the road below while Patrick stole a horse. I was finding it hard to think, hard to breath, hard to walk. I recognised one of the carriage drivers from the governor's household, and felt sure Mr Lalor would be using that carriage, which meant Emmeline and Samir would soon be inside it. The carriage was simple enough to be practical, but had the kind of quality required of someone in the queen's direct service. Mr Lalor would use it to get his prisoners to a more secure location, and soon. \n\nI pointed it out to Patrick at once. We found sacks large enough to take our friends, and made the grab from the opposite side of the carriage at the precise moment they were loaded inside.\n\nPatrick threw them over his horse's back, and we made a hasty exit. Mr Lalor shouted in rage as he realised what we'd done, but we kept our heads down and kept walking. He didn't find us.\n\nDoctor Normal met us on the road, and we helped Emmeline and Samir out of their sacks and into Doctor Normal's carriage. Patrick said goodbye to his horse, looking pleased with himself. Emmeline was uncharacteristically silent, and Samir had a deep cut on his forehead.\n\nWe drove away, expecting a hue and cry at any moment. Emmeline had turned us into high-profile criminals once more, and life would be trickier from now on. \n\nI needed to have a long, hard think about whether Emmeline's obsession with state independence was going to get us both killed.\n\nTHE END\n\n<img src=\"https://felicitybanks.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-11-28-09-pm.png?w=500\" width=\"350\" height=\"320\" alt=\"screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-11-28-09-pm.png\">\n\n[[Return to the beginning-> ]], or to [[Queen Victoria's entrance->\"What is the meaning of this!\"]], or visit the [[Exhibits]] or the [[Credits & Notes]]. \n\n[[Detailed Walkthrough & Mechanics]]\n</span><span id=\"box\">[[''Magic & Skills''->Magical Metals]]\n\n(if: $tin > 0)[//Tin = Popularity//](if: $tin < 1)[Tin = Popularity]\n(if: $lead > 0)[//Lead = Empathy//](if: $lead < 1)[Lead = Empathy]\n(if: $brass > 0)[//Brass = Physiology//](if: $brass < 1)[Brass = Physiology]\n(if: $iron > 0)[//Iron = Strength//](if: $iron < 1)[Iron = Strength]\n(if: $silver > 0)[//Silver = Know-how//](if: $silver < 1)[Silver = Know-How]\n(if: $gold > 0)[//Gold = Charm//](if: $gold < 1)[Gold = Charm]\n(if: $aluminium > 0)[//Aluminium = Grace//](if: $aluminium < 1)[Aluminium = Grace]\n\n<img src=\"https://felicitybanks.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_0870.jpg?w=500\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" alt=\"img_0870.jpg\">\n\n(link-goto: \"Back\", (history:)'s last) \n</span>",

For that, you are granted mercy... once.\" \n\n\"Thank you, Your Royal Majesty,\" I said, not quite understanding what she'd said.\n\nPrince Albert's footmen tied me to the central column and then brought in branches from outside to beat me. I wept in a mixture of pain at my punishment and relief that it was so light. \n\n\"Now get out of my sight,\" said the prince, and retired to tend to his queen.\n\nSamir and I left the area with uncommon rapidity, expecting to be called back at any moment. I leant on him, flushed with shame at my weakness.\n\nPatrick and Matilda ran to meet us. \"Don't worry,\" said Matilda. \"Doctor Normal's bought us a carriage to get out of here. You won't need to walk for long.\"\n\nTheir kindness almost undid me, but I gathered my strength and kept hold of the small dignity I had left. My back was hot and sticky with my blood. \n\nWhen we were thoroughly lost in the remaining crowd, we turned back to watch the queen's entourage pack up her tent and drive off in a long string of decorated carriages.

We had set out to humiliate Queen Victoria and popularise our own cause, and instead we'd caused a ruckus that could have killed thousands of innocent people. Her Royal Majesty had saved them, and I was grateful. \n\nMr Lalor attached heavy iron chains to my legs and to Samir. Poor Samir was a brave child, but he was still a child. His eyes were wide with awe and fear. He should have been in school or at work, not falling in with criminals like me.\n\nThe royal couple left, and the pavilion was disassembled around us. Soon we stood exposed to the jeers and spitting of the crowd. Mr Lalor, Mr Dickens, and the lady mechanic shielded us from the crowd as well as they could while they escorted us to a carriage that had been set aside to transport us to Bearbrass Gaol. \n\nAs we drew close I glimpsed Patrick and Matilda in the crowd, hurrying behind the carriage where Mr Lalor wouldn't see them. Samir entered the carriage before me, and I noticed a scuffle in the darkness. I guessed what was happening and quickly stepped inside, gasping as someone threw an enormous hessian sack over my head. They grabbed my waist and yanked me from the carriage with magic-enhanced strength, throwing me off my feet. \n\n\"Ready to go?\" Patrick whispered to me through the loose weave of the sack. \n\nI wriggled forwards to aid him, making my manacles clank together. He threw me over a horse's back next to Samir, and led the horse away. I heard Mr Lalor shout in rage as our escape was discovered, but we got away. For the moment. \n\nI had turned my closest friends into outlaws. Samir wasn't an adult yet, but he was already a wanted man because of me. \n\nI resolved to have a long, hard think about what I really wanted to do with the second chance I'd been given.\n\nTHE END\n\n<img src=\"https://felicitybanks.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-11-28-09-pm.png?w=500\" width=\"350\" height=\"320\" alt=\"screen-shot-2016-09-26-at-11-28-09-pm.png\">\n\n[[Return to the beginning-> ]], or to [[Queen Victoria's entrance->\"What is the meaning of this!\"]], or visit the [[Exhibits]] or the [[Credits & Notes]]. \n\n[[Detailed Walkthrough & Mechanics]]\n</span><span id=\"box\">[[''Magic & Skills''->Magical Metals]]\n\n(if: $tin > 0)[//Tin = Popularity//](if: $tin < 1)[Tin = Popularity]\n(if: $lead > 0)[//Lead = Empathy//](if: $lead < 1)[Lead = Empathy]\n(if: $brass > 0)[//Brass = Physiology//](if: $brass < 1)[Brass = Physiology]\n(if: $iron > 0)[//Iron = Strength//](if: $iron < 1)[Iron = Strength]\n(if: $silver > 0)[//Silver = Know-how//](if: $silver < 1)[Silver = Know-How]\n(if: $gold > 0)[//Gold = Charm//](if: $gold < 1)[Gold = Charm]\n(if: $aluminium > 0)[//Aluminium = Grace//](if: $aluminium < 1)[Aluminium = Grace]\n\n<img src=\"https://felicitybanks.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/img_0870.jpg?w=500\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" alt=\"img_0870.jpg\">\n\n(link-goto: \"Back\", (history:)'s last) \n</span>",
