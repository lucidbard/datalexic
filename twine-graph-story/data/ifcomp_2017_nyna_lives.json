She flutters back and forth across the cozy hut, plucking vials and herbs from the shelves and drawers. She has done this many times before, although the smells are new. It must be a new spell she\u2019s trying out. You elect to ignore her, settling back into your evening nap, when you are instead startled awake by a gentle hand. You lean into her palm as she strokes your fur.\n\t\u201cWake up, Nyna dear. I have a job for you.\u201d She coos [[sweetly->witch's request pt 2]].",
