Even the pebbles make you high.\\n\\n<<if visited(\"Cut Hair\")>>Authorities, in their wisdom innate to every thug, cleared a highway. You avoid it at first, presuming a manhunt underway. Instead, however, a film crew races along the empty road in a van towing a stretcher on a chain. A surgeon speeds alongside on a skateboard, also lashed to the vehicle. He operates solo on a hefty anesthetized patient bleeding into the air. It looks like a gastric bypass. Many ramps, potholes, and oil puddles lie ahead. Thanks to prison slaves, people can afford these ridiculous contests.\\n\\nYou, however, had to cut your own hair as a tool. After this lesson in sweet humbleness, one might wonder who seems freer.\\n<<else>>You randomly pass a huge woman on her neon green lawn. She chases a man in a giant chicken costume.

Mary developed her novel game, the grabber his manifesto, Oswald his new brand of magic, and Bruce his map to the cosmos.\\n\\nEven Matt affected social unrest with his grotesque art. After your escape you learn that a guard leaked pictures of Matt's disgusting cell to the media. He entered the facility a normal man and deteriorated beyond all social norms. Perhaps stories like this will put an end to the whole obscene system.\\n\\nThe prisoners, paradoxically free from distraction, noise, and relationships, had develloped their own mental manifestos. Perhaps all people have the potential for greatness, and history's geniuses merely crept away long enough to find their own.\\n<<if ($cards is \"held\") and ($cardsopen is \"no\")>>\\nYou often look at Mary's card pack on your huge mahogany shelf. You anonymously posted online the rules to her \"trust\" cardgame, calling it Mary's Game.

Other times, you wish you had given the cards away to a prisoner in need.\\n<<endif>>\\s\\n<<if $clip is \"mary\">>\\nHaving thought about Mary often, you doubt she will ever use the tranquilizer darts in an escape attempt. More likely, she failed to hide them well enough. The guards will have searched all the cells you opened and confiscated the clip.\\n<<endif>>\\s\\n<<if $cards is \"grabber\">>\\nThe grabber, whose name you still don't know, will probably reform himself with a little interaction from Mary. After all, who else will play cards with him?\\n<<endif>>\\s\\n<<if $manifesto is \"held\">>\\nAs for the grabber's manifesto, you found time to read it. The piece, surprisingly well writen, describes the history of politicians moving underground to prevent assassinations. The grabber advocates the assassination of voters in the fight for freedom. These deaths, he argues philosophically, count as self defense.\\n\\nYou have yet to decide wether to scan the pages and post them online.\\n<<endif>>\\s\\n<<if $clip is \"grabber\">>\\nYou recently heard of the grabber's escape, perhaps inspired by your own. He selfishly used the tranquilizer darts to free only himself. You picture him getting escorted out the hallway for factory work. Then, maybe he jabbed an unsuspecting guard in the neck to drug him. Then, perhaps he cut the guard's eyeballs out to fool the turets, all the while ignoring the controls that open the other cells.\\n<<endif>>\\s\\n<<if $clip is \"magician\">>\\nYou recently learned on the internet of Oswald's and Mary's escape. The magician must have expertly hid the darts before the guards turned the place inside out. You can imagine him drugging a guard on the way out to do factory work, a slight of hand trick he would have practiced for days. In the control room, he probably freed both Bruce and Mary. But Bruce must have decided to stay behind for Mira.\\n<<if (($wishbone is \"held\") or ($wishbone is \"worn\")) and ($cards neq \"magician\")>>\\nYou discovered online footage of a masked street magician working his way up and trying to reinvent magic. He sounds just like Oswald, an unforgettable voice. Hiding in plain sight seems like something he would do.\\n\\nYou've saved up some travel money, and next weekend you plan on returning his wishbone medallion...and seeing his reaction.\\n<<endif>><<endif>>\\s\\n<<if $cards is \"magician\">>\\nRegrettably, you set Oswald on a path of mastering card tricks already known by all. For who wouldn't play with cards all day after recieving a deck in solitary confinement?\\n<<endif>>\\s\\n<<if $hints <= 5>>\\nAfter your ingenious escape, you've had plenty of time to solve Oswald's mind reading trick. He exploits an obscure  field of psychology called pupillometry. Assuming heterosexuality, a person's pupils will dialate involuntarily when seeing an arousing image of the opposite sex. The same person's pupils will contract when seeing naked models of their own sex. The magician lets you see whatever perfect human form you choose, then knows based on close observation of the pupil response (or lack of response when picturing the formless God).\\n\\nSeparated by bars, Oswald used magnifying lenses in his wand to see your pupils from a distance. For up close performances he won't even need the wand, and the experience will feel like real magic indeed.\\n<<endif>>\\s\\n<<if $makeup is \"bruce\">>\\nYou like to believe Bruce swooned Mira with not one, but two gifts: your mirror and his makeup kit.

You must develop an escape plan in the limited time between guard rounds. Leave yourself enough time to return to your cell before the next guard arrives. One turn drains 10 seconds and occurs whenever you click a link (except the Info link).\\n\\nThe Bend command lets you contort in a way that best suits the situation. Clicking Plan reveals the next steps in your escape plan. It works like a hint button. But don't feel guilty for using it; escape requires many steps in a complex back-and-forth scheme. Click Plan at each cell encounter as you would use Look or any of the 14 verb commands available. For a challenge and special ending, only use Plan five times or less.\\n\\nYou cannot lose the game by losing items, and your cell is always safe, so experiment away.
