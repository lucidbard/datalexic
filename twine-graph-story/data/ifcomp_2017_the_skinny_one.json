Your sweatshirt reads 'The truth is out there.' Most people don't recognize the quote.\n\nYou and the guy--his name is Adam, you think--chat about TV shows.

You try to cajole them out of hiding, but they refuse to come near you. As much as it rips your heart out, you can't risk traumatizing them more by forcing them onto a walk. You move onto the other, [[more sociable dogs]] who clamor for your attention.\n\nYou crouch in front of Somers' cage. She's an energetic thing, a small terrier mix with tiny paws and huge brown eyes. Her ears quiver as you reach between the bars and scratch her head. Somers is one of your favorites, but she has been at the shelter for almost a year already. She is placed towards the front, where people first walk in to peruse the dogs up for adoption. You remember vividly seeing a family--a normal, suburban as all hell family--walk in and go right past Somers, even though she was practically crying for their attention. They adopted one of the newer puppies from a mill litter, a tiny, fluffy, white thing that was picturesque adorable but had the personality of cardboard and was scared of her new owners' shadows.\n\nYou open the kennel door and step inside to hook her up to a leash. You grab another dog, Boston, who likes to jump into your arms when he's done with walks, and take them outside. The shelter is located on a highway, which is never fun for new arrivals who can barely tolerate the feeling of pavement under their bruised paws, much less the assault of street noise. \n\nThe dogs tangle their leashes before long, and you laugh as they tumble through the dying grass like puppies.\n\n[[You should talk to your mom about adopting Somers again.|Somers]]\n\n<<if visited(\"adaptive19\") is 1>><<set $scholarship to $scholarship - 2>><<set $happiness to $happiness + 2>><</if>>",

A young female model poses in the newest fall line, dancing around in front of the Millenial pink background.

She nods in agreement.\n\n\"But you gotta admit, sometimes the gore and stuff serves a point. Remember that scene in Drag Me To Hell when she vomits everywhere? That's gross, but it served a point.\" Jess pauses. You don't like where this is going. \"Did you know some people think Drag Me To Hell is about the main character suffering with an eating disorder? That she kills herself at the end by jumping in front of a train, doesn't actually go to hell, because she can't stand living that way anymore?\"\n\n\"Yeah, and The Babadook got tagged as an LGBT film and now he's a gay icon. The Internet always says weird things about horror movies.\" You say, trying to brush it off.\n\n\"Look, Claire--did you want to talk about it?\" She ignores what you said about The Babadook.

She licks at your face.\n\nYou need to talk to your mom. Your apartment doesn't allow pets, but you'll drive home every weekend if it means you get to see Somers.\n\n\"You're my new therapist,\" you say.

      "text": "<<if $puppy is true>>You don't know how you ended up getting coffee with the guy from your bio class. You barely even know Adam. Why did you agree to go with him?\n\nYou think of seeing him at the shelter. If he volunteers at a puppy mill rescue, he must be a good person. \n\n\"How long have you worked at the shelter?\" He asks.\n\n\"Since freshman year. You started recently?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I used to work there, but I haven't for the last couple of years.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"My mom is one of the vets that Miranda and Jaime like to go to,\" he says. \"It's what made me want to be a vet.\"\n\n\"Oh, are you pre-vet?\"\n\n\"Yeah, but the odds of me getting into a good school are pretty slim after how badly I fucked up freshman and sophomore year.\" He sighs. \n\n\"I mean, I could help you study. If you want.\" \n\n\"That'd be cool.\"\n\n\"I decided I wanted to be a vet after working with the puppy mill dogs.\" You swallow hard as the memories surface, like ugly tangles of seaweed washing ashore. \"I went to an auction one time, with Jaime.\"\n\n\"I went to a few, too.\"\n\n\"What was it like? For you?\" You ask. You almost don't want to know. It hurts to remember going to the auction, even though it's so ingrained in your physical being it's like an extra muscle you refuse to exercise.  \n\n\"I think of the smell a lot. The dogs' paws.\" He runs a hand through his shoulder length black hair. \"At one of the auctions, there was a dog who didn't have her lower jaw anymore. My mom and Miranda were quick to rescue her. She lived with us for a few months, before she died. We named her Alice. By the end, she slept in my bed with me all the time. She was so scared of men when we first adopted her that she wouldn't go near me and my father.\"\n\nYour eyes are hot.\n\n\"I didn't see anything like that when I went to the auction. But I remember how hot it was. And...\" You swallow hard. \"There were all these people standing nearby, talking and laughing and trading advice. The people running the auction had put out a bowl of lemonade and some snacks. And they were just eating and drinking and talking like there weren't dying animals just a few feet away.\"\n\nYou scrub at your face. \"I wanted to go over and scream at them. Jaime had to grab me and keep me from saying anything.\"\n\n\"I can't go to auctions anymore,\" Adam admitted. \"I started screaming at someone from a mill. I don't even remember what happened, what started it. I just remember Miranda and Jaime telling me to get in the car.\"\n\n[[You stare down into your coffee as you and Adam sit in a strangely comfortable silence.|accept21]]\n\n<<elseif $puppy is false>><<set $Adam to $Adam + 2>>You don't know how you ended up getting coffee with the guy from your bio class. You barely even know Adam. Why did you agree to go with him?\n\n\"Nice shirt,\" he points to your \"Hannibal\" tee shirt. \"I liked that show. I'm sad it got cancelled.\"\n\nYou cup your hands around your cup of coffee. Black coffee has zero calories, so it's safe to drink. Even though your eyes flicker to the cookie that Adam got, you insist to yourself that you don't actually want it. Just think of the calories. Of the number on the scale increasing, making you a burden on this earth.\n\n\"Not a lot of people watched it.\" You smile as you think about your high school obsession. \"I used to always check the ratings after every episode. And when renewal season came around, I was always a mess. I was so upset when they cancelled it. A lot of people thought it was weird, that I was so into horror stuff. They liked Saw and the other gorefests, but I was into the real stuff. They still think it's kind of weird, honestly. I got called Maribal Lecter one time when I wore this shirt around my dorm freshman year.\"\n\n\"They just don't know what good TV is. Honestly, I think Maribal Lecter is kind of funny, but in a good way.\"\n\n\"That's how I chose to see it.\"\n\n\"I'm not into Saw or Hostel or anything like that. At least, not the gory sequels. The originals have value, in a cinematic sense. They ushered in a new wave of horror, and I can respec that.\"\n\n\"Oh, so you give Paranormal Activity credit for ushering in the found footage genre?\"\n\n\"I'd say Blair Witch Project had more of a role in that than Paranormal Activity.\"\n\n\"If you say so.\"\n\nYou debate about movies. First horror, then other genres. He's as much of a film snob as you are--his knowledge of movies is as pointlessly extensive as yours. You try to talk about movies with your friends, but they're never as into it as you are.\n\nSuddenly, you're agreeing to go to a hipster fest art festival with him. You feel conflicted about it. You have purposely not brought up Derek. Or the fact that he hates going to the cinema, which you can't comprehend. \n\n\"Hey, I need to get going to work on homework. But we should do this again some time.\" You stand up. You're running on three or four cups of coffee--you lost count. Zero calories, so it's safe. Safe, safe, safe.\n\n\"Okay, I'll text you.\"\n\nYou walk back to your apartment with your head spinning. You feel a little guilty about hanging out with Adam. It felt too much like a date. You should've brought up Derek.\n\nYou'll just have to be more careful next time you hang out. You wish you didn't have to deal with all of these--emotions. They're all so messy, dirty, uncomfortable. Like your own skin.\n\nWhen the number on the scale goes down, you feel less. You're aloof, above everyone else, floating like a cloud. That heavy darkness in your chest slinks away, and you're weightless.\n\nYou need to get the number lower. Then you won't have to deal with guilt or attraction or regret or any of the other nasty emotions you hate so much.\n\nYou'll finally be free. Flying. Flying.<</if>>\n\n[[Next|Day3]]",

It's a topic you feel passionately about--so passionately, that you switched majors and gave your parents premature grey hair. \n\nYou talked about it sometimes with your friends, but not extensively. You got too agitated, too frustrated. You cried a lot when you thought about it too much. Your friends and family understood where you were coming from, because, well, no one liked to think of dogs in pain. But no one truly got it, not the way Adam did.\n\nYou and Adam talk for a long time. About school, about the puppy mills, about...stuff. You and Adam talk about a lot of things, and sometimes you just sit in silence. You're never this comfortable with Derek. It catches you off guard, and you aren't sure what to think.\n\n\"I really need to go back and work on my homework.\" You say. You stand up. You've drank three cups of coffee. How long have you been sitting there? You aren't sure you want to know. \"I'll see you in class.\"\n\n\"See you later.\" He says.\n\nYou hurry out of the cafe. You walk back to your apartment. \n\nYou're confused. You think you like Adam, maybe too much, considering you have a boyfriend. A boyfriend you purposely never brought up in the conversation.\n\n$weight, $weight, $weight.\n\nYou're too heavy. Too full of--feelings. Emotions. You don't want any part of it. If you could get that number on the scale to go down, maybe you could start to feel less again. You could be happy, then. You wouldn't have to deal with the messy tangle of emotions that day to day life brought. You could be ethereal, like air, indifferent to everything around you.

You purposely refuse to look at them as they eat. \n\nOnce upon a time, early on in your, uh, new diet, you would go to the grocery store and wander around for hours. You'd go into the produce section and pick up different fruits and vegetables, hold them close to your face, smell them. You really liked the texture and weight of pomegranates. It was obsessive, and you're sure the store employees thought you were insane. But somehow, touching the food reassured you--like you could hold it in your hand and still choose to reject it, in the end.\n\nYou had stopped doing that a while ago, because the temptation had become too great. Your brain rewired itself, became obsessed with food. The smell, the texture, the appearance--it was all so quick to snag your attention, as much as you didn't want it to.\n\nSo now sitting across from Jess and Eliza, while they stuffed their faces with some of the fattiest foods imaginable, felt like absolute torture. You are tempted to snatch the food from their hands--to eat it or throw it on the ground, you aren't sure anymore.\n\nYou sit quietly while they chat. You don't trust yourself.\n\n\"You sure you don't want a fry, Claire?\" Eliza asks.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm fine.\" You wave her away. \n\n\"Has everything been okay lately?\" Eliza and Jess both look at you.\n\n1.

You're too nervous to admit you feel anything but friendship for Adam.\n\nAdam is already playing with Somers. You've noticed how much she adores Adam whenever you both work together. <<if $Somers is false>>She is your favorite pup in the shelter, although you would never say that out loud. You love all of the dogs equally, but Somers, a black and white terrier mix, has been at the shelter for almost a year. Even though she has the biggest heart of any dog you've ever met, people persistently walk past her in favor of traditionally \"cuter\" dogs. It makes you want to scream. Somers deserves all of the love in the world, and yet the cute little suburban families always gravitate towards the puppy mill rescues that are fluffy and white and have no personality. You know you shouldn't be so judgemental--and all of the dogs need homes anyway--but you just wish someone would see what a great pet Somers would be.<</if>>\n\n\"Hey,\" you smile and crouch down to greet Somers. She yips and prances under your hands. \n\n\"Are you saying hi to me or the dog?\"\n\n\"Both,\" you scratch behind Somers' ratty black ears. \"Are Miranda or Jaime here today?\"\n\n\"Jaime just left, but Miranda is probably going to be here soon.\" Adam hands you a leash. \"You can walk Somers.\"\n\n\"Where's Boston?\" You ask. <<if $Somers is false>>Boston was another favorite of yours, a King Charles Cavalier spaniel. He was vain and pompous, with majestic blond hair that tended to billow in the wind. He reminded you, in a strange way, of Chris Hemsworth, a la the Thor movies.<</if>>\n\n\"He got adopted.\" Adam walks past Brutus' cage. <<if $Somers is false>>Brutus was a cute little white bichon with anger issues.

Fully in control once more, you make your way across the coffee shop to Eliza.\n\nYou smile as you catch her eye.

It's not even worth contemplating, or you'll be ill.\n\n\"Hey, what's up?\" Eliza smiles and hugs you around the waist. She frowns slightly, but then she plasters that smile back on. \n\n\"Nothing much, how about you?\" You sit down across from her.\n\n\"I'm just working on my religion paper. And I have a freaking chem exam tomorrow, and I feel like I'm going to tear my hair out.\" She pulls another piece off her scone. \"I haven't seen you in a few days, unless you count snapchats of your lovely face.

But you have to eat if you don't want to die.\n\nAnd you're terrified to eat, to pollute your body with calories.\n\nSo which scares you more--living without the disorder...or not living at all?\n\n[[Next|Day5]]\n\n<<if visited(\"wrong63\") is 1>><<set $selfesteem to $selfesteem - 2>><<set $weight to $weight + 2>><</if>>",

You've never considered yourself a committment-phobe, but this situation with Adam makes you question that. \n\nWhen will you get the courage to pursue something--anything--with him? You know he'd make you happy. Your chest gets warm when you think of being with him, in that way. \n\nBut doubts always creep in and tarnish the golden glow around your thoughts of a future with Adam. What if he did say \"yes\"...but then, later, he realized he should have said \"no\"? He's barely peeked into those dark corners of yourself. He would run away screaming as soon as he saw all of the ugliness polluting your veins like sewage. He would come to resent you, just like all the others had. Everyone always left in the end, because they got tired of your insecurities and your doubts and your fears. No one deserved to put up with you.\n\nSo you clutched those visions of a future with Adam to your heart and used them to make you smile on a gloomy day. Perhaps, if you were whole again someday, you could be together. But not now.

It's just more proof of how fucked you are in the head. Even if you and Adam had never actually done anything, it still felt wrong. You hated yourself every time your mind wandered to a future with Adam. Derek was a perfectly nice guy. Why wasn't he making you happy? What was wrong with you? He was nice, outgoing, handsome. He should have been the perfect boyfriend. Every college girl's dream.\n\nYet you still thought about someone else. Adam wasn't necessarily a good-looking guy, at least not in a conventional sense; his midwestern stoicism sometimes made him as emotive as a rock; and you aren't sure if you would classify him as \"nice.\" But he made you feel something that Derek didn't. \n\nA rational person would have just broken up with Derek. He checked off all the right boxes and should have made you happy, but he didn't. So maybe it was time to just move on. \n\nBut a selfish fear lingered under the surface. What if you broke up with Derek and discovered that Adam didn't have feelings for you? You would have lost the comfort and security of your relationship with Derek, and could potentially ruin your friendship with Adam. \n\nNo, it wasn't worth the heartache. So you made yourself miserable thinking about Adam and maintaining a relationship with him, [[even though you feared it would never be what you wanted it to be.|diet40]]<</if>>",

      "text": "<b>About</b>\n\n\"The skinny one.\" was written as part of a university-funded summer research project. I worked with faculty mentors to ensure the veracity of the depiction of the disorder and the quality of the writing. Faculty from the psychology and English disciplines played a significant role in the development of this project, and I am incredibly grateful for the support I received from my university.\n\nThis project was inspired by a class I took my junior year of college about interactive fiction writing. Twine and Inform were the main platforms of interest in this class, and we surveyed a broad spectrum of the IF genre, from fun little fluff pieces to intense and emotional stories. One of the games we played was \"Depression Quest\" by Zoe Quinn, which acted as a huge inspiration for my project. \"Depression Quest,\" in my opinion, represented the potential for the IF genre to delve into deeper topics and I believe that the unique properties of this genre--the player's ability to guide the narrative, the complex relationship between the player and the protagonist, and the immersive language--make it especially conducive to being an educational tool for understanding mental illness and addressing cultural, racial, and gender-based disparities. \n\nAs to why I chose eating disorders, I think, in the interest of full disclosure, I need to say that I have never personally struggled with an eating disorder. The character of Claire is  not based on myself or anyone I know. I have known people who have struggled with EDs, however, and I've done a lot of research into gender, body image, and eating disorders over the last five or six years. Although many mental illnesses are not well understood, eating disorders tend to be especially mysterious and misunderstood by the general populace. There is a terrible conception that EDs are a \"phase\" for young women, the result of \"poor self-control\" or a \"diet gone wrong,\" and can be resolved by just \"eating a sandwich.\" EDs are far more complex. \n\nOn a fundamental level, the eating disorder (whether it's anorexia, bulimia, or anything in between) is an expression of complicated and painful internal feelings that the sufferer cannot fully resolve. The disorder acts as an outlet to express these emotions. Internal angst becomes intertwined with the physical self. \n\nWhile the consumption, or lack thereof, of food is the focal point of the disorder, it is not simply about counting calories or seeing the numbers on the scale go down. Rather, it is about what these things represent. For people with eating disorders, food, calories, and hunger have incredibly complicated symbolic meanings. Food no longer serves a nutritional value; rather, it has symbolic value. That is why people with eating disorders often practice ritualistic eating (such as eating things based on color or keeping different foods carefully separated on a plate). Human beings, unlike many animals, have the unique ability to attribute abstract qualities to food, and this can result in the development of eating disorders. \n\nThere is even a biological basis for eating disorders. More and more research indicates that EDs are genetic, and that if you have a family member with an eating disorder, you are more likely to have an eating disorder. Additionally, those with anorexia may have a biological component to the development of their disorder. Patients with anorexia tend to have higher levels of serotonin in the body, which result in nervousness and discomfort, and the act of starving themselves may be an attempt to deplete the excess serotonin. This is just the beginning of the biological research into EDs, and I can imagine that there will be more studies in the future that delve deeper into the biological and genetic elements that contribute to EDs. \n\nAlthough this narrative cannot fully encapsulate the experiences, thoughts, and behaviors of someone living with anorexia and it by no means serves as a full replication of life with this disorder, I have done my best to at least give some critical insight into the thought processes of those who must suffer day to day with anorexia. I hope that Claire can help you understand some of the darker, less frequently discussed elements of anorexia, so perhaps you can see beyond the one-dimensional portrayal of eating disorders in the media and begin to have more understanding and empathy for a disorder that's often swept aside as \"just a phase\" or by phrases like \"just eat a sandwich.\" Only 13% of adolescents with eating disorders will ever seek treatment, yet it is considered one of the deadliest mental health disorders with the highest mortality rate.\n\nIt is important to note that this story in no way endorses eating disorders or eating disorder behaviors. It should be clear by the end of the story that this is, in fact, a hellish, painful, and dangerous way to live, with no true value or benefits. There are significant health risks that come with an eating disorder, and the psychological, emotional, and social ramifications of EDs are not remotely worth engaging in these behaviors. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. Please think of what you would be sacrificing by starting down this path. \n\nUltimately, I hope that reading Claire's story gives you a better understanding of the mindset of those with EDs. While a \"game\" like this cannot act as a \"mental illness simulator,\" and that is indeed not remotely my intention, I hope that experiencing Claire's story in this immersive genre will help illuminate the complexities of this disorder and raise awareness for it.\n\n<<back \"Back\">>",

Still, you and dad were going to go on your daily run.\n\nA few weeks ago, you and dad had started running together. When your dad was in high school, he ran on the track team. You'd seen the old medals and trophies, felted with dust, packed away in boxes in the attic. \n\nEven with his track days behind him, he still liked to run to get his daily exercise.

The disorder is the only way to make her feel good and whole and perfect, and like she's in control of her own life.

Although we have come a long way in recent years towards destigmatizing many mental health disorders, there is still misinformation pushed to the general public that creates a tangible barrier between those dealing with mental illness and those who do not. One way to tear down this barrier is to provide education and information that can help those who do not live with mental health disorders to better understand, and empathize with, individuals who must live day to day with mental illness. \n\nMy project focuses specifically on the daily struggles of living with an eating disorder. An often misunderstood and oversimplified disorder, I hope that following Claire's story can give those without an eating disorder better insight into what life is truly like for someone with anorexia. It is not simply a matter of \"not wanting to eat.\" This disorder is much more complex than you may have been led to believe, and the sufferer's abnormal relationship with food merely scratches the surface of a psychologically tormenting and emotionally draining disorder. Eating disorders do not just effect someone's physical appearance or health--they go much deeper and invade every aspect of a sufferer's life. \n\nAlthough this narrative cannot fully encapsulate the experiences, thoughts, and behaviors of someone living with anorexia and it by no means serves as a full replication of life with this disorder, I have done my best to at least give some critical insight into the thought processes of those who must suffer day to day with anorexia.

There are significant health risks that come with an eating disorder, and the psychological, emotional, and social ramifications of EDs are not remotely worth engaging in these behaviors. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. Please think of what you would be sacrificing by starting down this path. \n",
