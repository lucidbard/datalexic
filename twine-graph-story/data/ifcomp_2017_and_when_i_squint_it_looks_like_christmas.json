That's good, because I don't want to trip and slow us down, or take too long looking.\\n\\nOn the left side, Julip is doing good too, but he's moving slower than me.

I think he doesn't want to get hurt, like me.\\n\\nBut finally, we reach the tree.  Part of the moss comes out of Delvaire's chair and goes onto the bark.  It presses itself on an small indentation that I hadn't noticed from a distance.\\n\\nThen, part the bark slides back, like a door, and the moss goes back in the chair, mixing with the rest.\\n\\nDelvaire turns to me, letting go of my hand.\\n\\n\"[[How well can you climb, Polly?|30]]\"\\n",

But then she comes forward, and wordlessly raises a hand.\\n\\nInstantly, moss breaks off from the back of her chair, splits, and dashes forward, like two huge snakes.  The first one reaches Raleigh's legs and wraps around them, causing her to fall.  \\n\\n\"NO!\"\\n\\nShe sits up on the ground, and for a moment it looks like she's going to crawl away.  But then the other moss snake reaches her, and ties her wrists together.  Growing tiny feet, the moss walks back to us, holding my sister.\\n\\n\"NO!  NOOOO!  POLLY!\"\\n\\nI look down at Raleigh.  She's still screaming and thrashing, and hot tears run down her face.  I've never, <i>ever</i> seen my sister like this.  She struggles and screams like she's going to die if she doesn't.\\n\\nDelvaire comes next to me, watching Raleigh with sad eyes.  Wordlessly, she raises her hand again.  Another piece of moss breaks from her chair and slides over my sister's mouth.  \"We don't want to attract Rackers,\" Delvaire says quietly.  Still, Raleigh continues to scream, though the sound is muffled because of the moss.\\n\\n\"I'm sorry, Rallie,\" I whisper, putting my face in my hands.  What have I done?\\n\\n\"We . . .\"  I look at Delvaire.  She opens and closes her mouth, looking numb.  Then she shakes her head.  \"We need to find a place to rest.  I know of a cave not far in the Western Terrace.  Follow me and . . . and stay close.\"\\n\\nShe starts walking, and the moss on Raleigh walks too, bringing her with us.  Julip looks down at my sister as if to say something, but she's still thrashing and screaming, though the moss holds tight.  Instead, Julip lowers himself on the ground, and I get on his back.\\n\\n[[We go back into March Marsh territory, and we ride.|78]]",
