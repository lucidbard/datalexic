I suspect they bribed Mulligan, our chief technician, to sign false inspection reports.\"\n\n\"I don't know if anyone but me survived the explosion. I grabbed a breath mask in time, so that gas didn't kill me. But I was attacked by a service robot which shot me twice. I had a gun. I managed to immobilise the robot. I ran off to my office.\"\n\n\"Not long ago I accidentally discovered that the facility's assistant AI has a surprising range of so-called \"emergency rights\", quite ineptly masked. This got me suspicious. I've studied the matter in secret for the last few weeks. These \"emergency rights\" activated after the accident. Before I wrote this, I had blocked the AI's access to all key systems. Right now the AI is trying to bypass my blockades. This program was designed by OSMiC to cover the traces in case of an accident, by destroying all evidence. This program controlled the robot that shot me. OSMiC would rather see the station destroyed completely, so that no one can determine the cause of the explosion, than allow the public to learn about their misconduct, which would cost them millions in damages.\" \n\n\"I've no strength left. I hope someone reads this. I hope OSMiC pays. The pain is unbearable. I'm going to take off the mask. The gas is at least going to end this quickly.\"\n<<set $sashasnoteread to true>>\\\n\n\n<span id=\"tab\">[[Back|longpc]]</span>",
