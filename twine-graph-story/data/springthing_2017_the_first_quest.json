You can choose to live out the sickest of your fantasies today, right now, in real time, yet still be hailed as a hero. You have unlimited contol and... power. You look at the kitty in your hands and you rub your face against his belly. He appreciates it. You then turn your face into his belly and lick it. He appreciates it. And then you open your jaws and bite. And you bite harder and harder. He does not appreciate it. As he squirms more and more viciously, your grip becomes stronger. your jaws become stronger. You finally rip a chunk of flesh free from the kitty. He does not appreciate it. He is thrashing violently and yelping very loudly. You go in for another bite. And another. The kitty is running out of breath. It becomes limp. It appreciates it. You monster. Curiosity satisfied, you move on to your [[next conquest.|Dragon]]\\n\\n<<display Stats>>\\n<<display ScopeCharges>>\\n<<if $smith_visited is \"yes\">><<display WeaponDisplay>><<endif>>",

The hero is always painted as the aggressor, looking for fights to pick, to gain more experience, more money, more glory. And with some, she's right. I've seen many a hero in both my human and dragon form who adventure without care for the ripples their actions create. And I've hypothesized for a while that in this clause lies the cure. The curse has merely prevented me from communicating that until now.\"\\n\"So I must vow not to fight or kill you?\"\\n\"I think so. I've been able to feel more like myself the longer you stall. Perhaps a vow will tip it over the edge.\"\\n[[\"I vow that I will never fight or kill you, dragon, Emi.\"|TrueEnding]]\\nPart of you still knaws at you. This could potentially spell a massive trap. This dragon is smart, and could be very well trying to trick you. Plus, killing this dragon will help the entire town, and be a good start to your adventuring career.\\n[[Slay the dragon|Slay]]\\n",
