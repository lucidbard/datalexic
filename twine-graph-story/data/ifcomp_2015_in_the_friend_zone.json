You were just background decoration! All you ever were, even here.\n\n\"I was so //close// to it,\" Two intones, pounding their fist against the knight's pauldron. \"I could taste $interestObject on my //tongue//!

I'm gonna make $interestObject remember me\u2014forget you, and everybody else.\n\n\"But don't worry\", Two whispers as they raise the glittering fragment to strike. \"Maybe I'll make $interestObject confide in you, one last time. I'll make $interestObject tell you about it. I'll make $interestObject tell you how excited $interestSubject (if:$plural)[feel](else:)[feels] everytime I stick my-KGRRRRK!\"\n\nThe knight's body erupts in a blinding white flash even as Two's voice collapses into slush.

The blade's other end protrudes from the back of Two's neck, where it gathers a thin stream of blood along its length. Blinding blue flame streams furiously from its helmet, blackening the surrounding metal. It screams with a voice of thousands, rattling the steel girders that span the bridge above: \"YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THIS PLACE. YOU DO NOT RESPECT THE POWER YOU PRESUME TO WIELD. YOU DO NOT DESERVE TO HAVE A THROAT.\"\n\nThe knight rips its sword away from Two's neck, taking their trachea with it. Two's breathing collapses into wet gasps. \"Hggrrk... Kkkkhk... Hrrrrrrgh...\"\n\nWith one kick the knight sends the crumpled $niceGuy ten meters across the asphault, leaving a streak of blood behind them. Pursuing them into the shadows beyond the streetlamp it bashes them with the broad side of its sword over and over again: One, two, three, four, five strokes. You hear Two's ribcage collapse with a sickening crunch; you hear tibia snap like twigs.
