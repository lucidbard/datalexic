And at the same time, I really don't.  I'm worried about what will happen.  \n\nIt doesn't seem real.  It's still so far away.  Because the date here...it isn't your today.  It's my today.   It isn't the day you [[found out everything]], but the day I began to [[understand]] everything.  \n\nI know you [[kept the rest of these]].  Hopefully they help.  Hopefully they're enough of an [[apology]].  And hopefully...the one's I've left behind, all the ones I couldn't send you, help as well.\n\nYou deserve it.\n\nThis might be the last letter I write to you. It might not be.\n\nEither way, I'm going to miss you. \n\n[[Love]] and [[Sunsets]], \n\nCadence\n\n",

      "text": "August 10, 2011\nHey Dear, \n\nDo you remember last summer?  During the few weeks when I was back home?\n\nThere was one day, a Thursday I think.  We walked around Western Hills and laughed at the pretentious houses.  We went into Town Square, our shoes scrabbling against the rough concrete as we just strolled through different stores. \n\nAnd we just talked.  We didn't care about the floods of people pooling around us, flowing in and out of the streets and sidewalks and stores.  It was just us, really. \n\nWe ended up in that dinky little park in the center of the Square, staring up at the mountains.  It was hot as hell outside, like 90 degrees, but it didn't matter.  \n\nThe sun started to dip, dip past the buildings, past the mountains.  As it said goodbye, the sky slowly exploded in colors.  Orange and pink and peach waves lapped over the blue sky, tinged the perfectly offwhite clouds. \n\nI sat in silence.  You buzzed around for a while, snapping photos with your Kodak. I think it took you thirty minutes until you were satisfied with a result.  I wonder how many pictures you deleted before you came up with your perfect five.  You always only keep five of the same scene, right?\n\nBut eventually you sat down on the dying grass with me, and we talked again.  I can't even remember what we talked about, but I guess it doesn't matter. It wasn't the [[words]] that mattered, but the fact that I had a friend there.\n\nThe next week, you gave me a [[small picture]] of that sunset.  Wallet sized.  \n\nI still keep it with me. It's crinkled a little bit on the top left corner, but it's still with me. I hold it when I'm scared.\n\nIt's in my hand right now, as I stare out into the open field, the sun dipping past the trees. \n\nBest wishes, \n\nCadence",

But really, they're all the same types. \n\nThe counselors always round us up in this introductory group, where we have to introduce ourselves, tell what's bothering us, what we like to do, whatever. \n\nAs if any of us give a shit.  \n\nAny of the ones who do give a shit are deluded. \n\nThere's a craft room, but it's full of crayons and coloring books and water colors for the young kids.\n\nA TV rec room.  They didn't really like my suggestion to watch Pulp Fiction.  Too \"Graphic\".\n\nBullshit\n\nThe girls are in gradeschool or all too ready to cause shitty drama.  Always gossipping or whispering about some shit or another.   I saw [[one]] try to rifle through my journal just for the lols - I threw one of my stress relief balls at her neck.\n\nThey work very well- I felt a lot less stressed. \n\nBut she's my roommate, so I might as well try to [[play nice]]. \n\nOh well.  Day 1 outta 80 down.\n\nFuck me, \nCadence",

      "text": "<memories>\nYou'd never seen a house that large before, not in person at least.  \n\nIt was a three story house. Their yard was more like a garden.  Something that green was rare in the desert. Most homes were landscaped with grainy rocks, and the occaisional island of grass. \n\nThe entire neighborhood was like that.  Each house unique in everything  besides their size.  \n\nCadence's house was made of stone.  Gray against the cerulean sky.  Like a castle without the regality.  \n\nThe door had stained glass.  Blues and purples and grays, twirling around in a mix of triangles and squares. \n\nShe answered the door, a bundle of energy, inviting you in. \n\nShe flippantly waved her hands.  The inside was even more ridiculous, but you doubt she noticed you fidgeting with your watch. The fidgeting was normal, the magnitude was not.  \n\nDinner.  The dining table felt as long as one of the school hallways. \nA deep red wooden table, a perfectly cut rectangle. \n\nYou counted twenty seats. \n\nCadence waltzed around the room, pulling out a chair.  \n\n\"My Guest?\" she flourished, sticking her tongue out at the end.  You took a second to guess that she wanted you to sit down. You almost tripped into the chair as you shuffled over. \n\nWithout looking, she slipped herself into a chair across from you.  Her grace had a nonchalant bitterness to it.  \n\nHer father came into the room a moment later. He had a wiry frame, trapped inside a fitted gray suit and a white button up underneath.  He was thin, sharp.  \n\nHe talked to you.  A series of questions. \n\n\"How are you?\"\n\n\"What do you want to do? When you grow up, that is?\"\n\n\"What do you like to do in your free time?\"\n\n[[\"Where do you live?\"]]\n\n\"Does Cadence give you much trouble?\" A roll of the eyes. \n\n\"You seem like a nice kid.  She needs that.\" \n\nHis voice was deep, but bordered on a monotone.  His gaze felt like knives poking at the side of your head as you numbly nod your head.  Trembling. \n\nCadence rallied.  For the sharpness on the left side of you, in front of you there was the biting airiness of snark. It seemed overplayed.\n\nIt was one of the most awkward dinners of your life - and that was really saying something, for you at least. It lasted about an hour. \n\nAll you could do is nod and [[whisper]]. \n\nShe walked you out, just as she walked you in.  She rambled about a million and two things, excited.\n\nShe said most of the kids around here went to a private school nearby. It was closer than the public school you both went to, but she stated confidently \"there's no way that place could handle me.\"  \n\nYou nodded, just as you normally do. \n\nTurning your head, you could see her father, standing at one of the house's pillars (it even had fucking pillars - they looked Greek).  He seemed to smile at you.  \n\nBack where you began, in the frame of the door. \n\nYou hugged her.  She held on a little longer than you expected. \n\n[[\"Goodbye\"]]\n\n\"See you later, Cadence.\"\n\n</memories>\n",

She had a strong spirit, determined.  Despite difficulties in attending class due to appointments and check ups, she pushed on and received A\u2019s and B\u2019s in her classes.  She loved to write, and her parents attest that she could spend hours in her room, blasting music and crafting sonnets.  \nHer friends know her for her charm, her energy, and her impeccable sense of sarcasm.  She drew people in with her warmth.  She was [[adventurous]], attending concerts and operas and [[museums]] in her spare time.  She will be deeply missed by her family, her friends, and her community in Palms. \nThe service will be held on August 10th from 12:30 pm to 4:00 pm at the Linden Church.

It's a waste of my goddamn time.\n\nSo if someone decides \"Let's rifle through my roommate's bags for shit to make fun of\", I reach high levels of fuck-no.  \n\nThe answer, though, isn't revenge.  Revenge becomes this downward spiral of two people shitting on eachother, and nothing is accomplished.

Because then, after you set boundaries, I prefer to kill with kindness. Then shit doesn't escalate.\n\nBout a 68 percent success rate.\n\nSide effects may include:\n1. Strange looks.\n\n2.

I don't really see outside of my own perspective I guess.\n\nI've hurt a lot of people from this.\n\nI've probably hurt you a number of times. Dear god, I'm sorry. \n\nI get caught up though.  In anger, in happiness, in guilt, in whatever.  And I forget everything I have, and I forget the people near me and how they feel.\n\nI was a complete bitch when I went over to your house the first time.  I still reel over the shit I said.  And yet you took it all. You were so patient, even as I was shitting on your fucking home.  \n\nOne day, I'm going to die. I can accept that. CLL is rare in kids.  But it happens, apparently.  I'm at stage one right now, but I could jump up a stage at any minute if I do the wrong treatment. How I've hid it, I really don't know. I frequently get sick. Maybe all the pills I've got hidden at the bottom of my backpack.\n\nAnd it's really hard to see this, sometimes, but I am lucky. In a weird way.  And it hurts to say so.  But both my parents have great jobs - we have so many resources.  The reason I'm not in private school is because I'd fall way behind with how much school I miss.  I have access to doctors and appointments and experimental treatments and I can go to a fancy treatment center every summer, even if I shit on it all the time, it's a blessing.  \n\nIf we had less, I could have already been dead. \n\nI have parents who put as much time and effort into me, just me, as possible, even when everything else in their lives seems to be falling apart.  As if they're putting their lives on hold until the final beep blares from a monitor. \n\nAnd that's hard to accept.  I know it's because they care, but I can't help but feel responsible.  And half the time, I don't even notice how they try, because of my tunnel vision.  Whenever I remember again, it sucks. \n\nIt hurts to see their exhausted eyes.  And their sad smiles after leaving the doctors office.  As if they're trying to be brave for me.\n\nI can accept the fact that I will be dead, possibly soon. \n\nI can't accept this pain now though.  I can't accept seeing their broken hearts.  \n\nI can't imagine seeing yours. \n\nI know how Gabriella felt.  She was more frustrated than I was- her family has a lot, lot less than mine, and yet she was at all the same places I was.  Same treatment center over the summer. Even more experimental drugs and trials.  Homeschooled to give her more flexibility in doctors appointments and treatments.\n\nAnd she put a brave smile for me too, in the end.  I knew the look all too well.  The softened eyes, the slouched shoulders, the sympathetic hand on my back, and the small corners upturned at the edges of their lips.  \n\nAnd then they all say, \"I love you.\"\n\nIt took me a while, but if I've learned anything about this world, it's that \"I love you\" really means \"Goodbye\". \n\n\nI'm so sorry, \n\nCadence. \n\n\n(link:\"Start Over\")[(gotoURL:\"Letters.html\")]\n",

I don't feel like I'm living.\n\nIt feels weird, going to school, getting grades, meeting people.  I'm pretending, in this little bubble, that I know there will be a tomorrow.\n\nBut I never know.  \n\nAnd yet, there's this little voice in the back of my mind, telling me to not waste my time thinking I don't have any left. Because there's that small chance I could make it.  \n\nYou know me more than anyone else. But you don't know me at all, not really.  And that's not your fault. \n\nI show you an image.  The hyper, anti-establishment writer. \n\tNever the contradicitons.  Opened a window, never a door. \n\nBut I showed you my poetry - as if that was ever enough.  Giving you glimmers of truth, but with no context. Feelings, never the facts.  \n\nI write so I can say the truth without saying anything at all. \n\nBut for once, I'm going to be real. \n\nI love you.\n\nThank you, \n\nCadence \n\n\n(link:\"Start Over\")[(gotoURL:\"Letters.html\")]\n",
