You simply beamed as you watched them pour into the park, chatting with each other and eyeing the feast laid out on the long plastic tablecloths.\n\nBefore people could sit down in the folding chairs set on the browning grass, you made a point of greeting every single one of them, with a wide smile and a handshake so firm that many of them walked away rubbing their wrists. It was what any gracious host would do, and as the Ronton Neighborhood Association chairman, you wanted to make a good impression. Listening closely to their chatter, which, given your position in the community, you considered less <<linkappend \"//eavesdropping//\">>, regardless of what Bram said,<</linkappend>> and more //surveying//, you were making a very good one indeed.\n\nYes, everything was going perfectly until, as you said with difficulty, you started to feel \"a bit crappy\". Beads of sweat dripped down your chin and your vision blurred, and people began to crowd about you in concern right up until you vomited on the table. It turned out that \"crappy\" was a terribly understated description of your heart attack, especially with the <<linkappend \"suffocation\">>, which you personally found excessive, <</linkappend>> on top of it. Though someone called 911 as soon as you started convulsing, and the EMTs tried their damndest to save you, things ended in a non-miraculous way.\n\nIn other words, you're a ghost now.\n\n[[Welp.|Title]]",

It was the least we could do so the poor man could have something to eat...poor Mort, oh!\n\n\"We headed to the park after that... to help set up, you know? When the dinner started, before the poor man could die of hunger, we gave Mort our salad - oh, and Annie, she gave him a sandwich. Then Erin...Erin gave him a silly little potion, going on and on about protection or something. He drank it, though I can't imagine why, and well...! Next thing you know he's dead on the floor!\n\n\"That girl, I just - she has no idea what she's doing with her so-called magic, I wouldn't be surprised if drinking that finally...oh I don't want to think about it! But she's done terrible things before...regardless, whoever did it should be ashamed...\"\\\n<<if hasVisited(\"Justin and Terry at the grocery store\")>>\n\n<<used \"Terry's Testimony\">><</if>>",

We'd baked everything the day before- Annie, Bram, and I, and for some reason Mort didn't like it. There was a bad aura around everyone beforehand, but then it got really bad at the meeting. Annie's aura flared up, and of course everyone loves Annie so everyone else got frustrated -\n\n\"Well, Mort didn't want to eat any of the dishes - couldn't? He said something like that.  I kept trying to give him the potion, but he ignored me! Everyone ignores me. He left all angrily, and then Justin and Terry went off to get Mort something, salad maybe? I didn't pay too much attention. Well, I did, but not because I was stalking them or anything. I was just concerned about Justin. He hasn't been talking to me at all. I tried to tell him about the bad energies and signs I've felt lately, but he wouldn't listen, and then this had to go and happen!\n\n\"Anyway, we all set up the dinner for a couple hours. Then I gave Mort the potion at the party. I watched him drink it and then went back to the party, feeling better, until...\n\n\"I had prepared the potion for Mort because I thought he was in danger, and I was right.\n                      \n\"Ingredients that protect [were in the potion], of course.\n\n\"I thought the potion would work.

It's daylight streaking across the community garden - the real one - and Bram is there talking to Annie, who is seated on a white stone bench. \n\nBram hands a small brown bag over to Annie, and she takes out a small notepad. \"I can't pay you right now,\" she says, \"but - \" \n\n\"I know,\" Bram says. \"You can pay me later.\" \n\nAnnie hums in acknowledgement and writes a note to herself. \"Y'know, it never seemed quite right to me that there're illegal plants.\"\n\nBram shrugs. \"Well, you know how it is. Not all laws make sense, and some people are just too harsh about what's wrong or right.\"\n\n\"If you're gonna bad mouth Justin, I'm not here for it,\" Annie says matter-of-factly as she put the bag into her purse.\n\nBram opens and closes his mouth a couple times, like a fish. \"Of course not.\" He continues, \"It //is// pretty weird that it's illegal, isn't it? I mean, I feel like the law - not all of it,\" he adds quickly in response to another warning look from Annie, \"but a lot of it, associates the stuff with, you know, teenage stoners. Historical precedent, I guess? But there are people who are using it medicinally,\" he gestures to her and she nods, \"and I don't see why that's not alright. At least it's helping people. Unlike some plants out there...\"\n\n\"What do ya mean by that?\" Annie closes her eyes and tilts her head up to bask in the sunlight.\n\n\"Um, uh...there's a lot of poisonous plants that probably should be banned but aren't.\"\n\n\"I can't see why them poisonous species would need to be banned unless someone was growin' them on purpose. And I can't think of any good reason for that.\"\n\n\"Well, actually, I am, uh, doing that,\" Bram says awkwardly, rubbing his neck.\n\n\"What?\" She frowns disapprovingly.\n\n\"I'm growing wolfsbane. Every part of it is poisonous: stem, leaves, petals; it's dangerous just to touch it. It's fascinating really...\" he trails off at Annie's hard stare. \"Uh, I'm not doing it not to hurt anyone though, I swear...! It's just, Erin uses it for protection. Against lycanthropy, I think, but I'm not sure.\" Annie raises an eyebrow, and Bram shrugs again. \"Witchcraft. That's all I got. I'm growing it over here, I can show y- huh.\"\n\n\"Somethin' wrong?\"\n\nBram has walked over to a bed that's labeled: CAUTION, DO NOT TOUCH. There's a purple flower here, and it looks a bit mishandled. \"Some of the leaves are ripped off.\" He pales. \"That's.

The scene is dark, but Erin's blonde hair manages to refract the light from the dull streetlamps anyway, making her stand out noticeably as she walks down the boulevard. You almost make a note to check the last time the bulbs were changed, but then you remember you are dead. Bummer. \n\nShe gives each house on the block a hard stare, frowning more and more as she walks along. Pieces of tape and paper cling to the doors she passes, and you recognize them as the remnants of the sigils you took down. Her expression gets darker with every barren door.\n\nAbruptly, she stops in the middle of the sidewalk and makes an annoyed noise, then digs for something in her purse. To your <<linkappend \"surprise\">> and dismay<</linkappend>>, it's another sigil - you didn't realize she made <<linkappend \"//more//\">>(You can't even take them down now!)<</linkappend>>. She stomps up to a house and angrily fixes it on the door.\n\n\"He can't appreciate when someone is just trying to help can he?\" she mutters, more bitterly than you knew was possible for her. Adopting a nasally <<linkappend \"tone,\">>(your voice sounds nothing like that)<</linkappend>> she quotes, \"'You can't do this, Erin.' 'Vandalism is a crime, Erin.' 'Stop putting sigils up or I'll kick you off the association and call the police, Erin.'\" She gives a sharp little laugh. \"As if the police would care. I just want to protect everyone, and you're not stopping me.\" \n\nContinuing along the road out of the residential area and into the town proper, Erin puts sigils up on various buildings until she reaches the graveyard. For a moment, you wonder if she's going to go inside, and if you have the nerve to follow her. Instead, she mouths something that looks like \"this'll show him\" and begins scattering violet petals around the front gate.\n\nAfter a few moments of scattering petals and chanting...something, she turns back toward the street and her eyes widen, her mouth parting into a little o-shape. You turn to see what she's looking at, and as you do you see someone dressed in dark clothing walking in the distance toward the main part of town, holding something long that glints silver in the moonlight.\n <<add \"Shifty Person\">> <<add \"Petals\">>\n\nThat's...<<linkappend \"suspicious\">>\n\nNo, that's really, //really// <<linkappend \"suspicious\">>\n\nRonton is a quiet neighborhood, just shy of a thousand people, and it's not exactly known for its night life.

Justin is sitting at a table, staring blankly at a newspaper in his hands. Based on the date on the front page, it's the day before Thanksgiving.\n\nTerry walks in. \"Justin?\"\n\n\"Hm?\" He looks over. She's holding a few pieces of paper that you recognize as the article.\n\n\"You and Annie are in charge of the menu for tomorrow, right?\" \n\nJustin nods. \"We are.\" \n\n\"I've been reading, and,\" she pauses, but continues with more conviction, \"it turns out nuts have a multitude of health benefits. I printed out an article.\" \n\nTerry hands Justin the article, and as he's reading, she says, \"I just thought that if we're making dinner for the community, it might be good to have the meal be, well, //good// for them.\"\n\n\"That would be nice, yeah.\" Justin keeps scanning his eyes over the page, though you get the feeling he's processing the conversation rather than actually reading.\n\n\"We are a group for the wellbeing of the community. What good would we be if we didn't give them what's best for them?\" \n\nHe turns his head to look at her. \"I'll ask Annie.\"\n\n\"About adding the nuts to the menu?\" She grins widely at him.\n\nNodding, Justin smiles at his wife. \"Yes.

He squats down to get a better look and so do you, as you only got to glance at it before. Wolfsbane is actually a rather pretty plant, you think to yourself, with numerous deep-purple petals hanging off a delicate stalk. Its beauty is clear despite this one looking worse for wear, with several petals having fallen to the ground, flowers battered, stem kinked. You examine the remaining leaves on the plant and, with a sinking feeling, realize they match the leaves that were in the bag Terry's boyfriend gave her.\n\nOh god. No, maybe there's still a chance -\n\nBram looks down at the ground next to the plot then presses his finger to something in the dirt. You peer closer; it's some sort of circular indentation. There's another a foot or so away, and another a little further - they must track out of the garden.\n\n\"The cane,\" you hear Bram exhale, and you whirl around to look at him. He has an expression of realization on his face. And then you remember - the boyfriend in question and his damned fancy cane. It must have left imprints in the dirt. That confirms it - he stole the wolfsbane leaves from the garden and gave them to Terry. Which in turn means...\n\nNo.\n\nYou don't want to consider it. Terry? Kill you? You want to say there's no reason for it, even though a little voice in your mind tells you there are many. Still, how did she? How could she?

It's - it's weird to see yourself though, you must say. You look pretty good for a man about to die. Your suit is impeccably ironed, and the comb-over is hardly noticeable.\n\nYou see Erin approach you - that is, your living counterpart. She's holding out a potion, the same one that she tried to get you to drink all that fateful day. As she corners still living Mort, you think back to how you felt at that moment. You were kind of pissed off because you really did //not// want to drink her concoction - who knows what she put in it? You didn't want to create a fuss though, so you kept either ignoring her or brushing her off instead of telling her to scram like you wanted to.\n\nShe'd approached you multiple times before, each time more insistent that you drink the damn thing. As time passed and you kept refusing, she became more agitated. In fact, by the time you agreed to drink whatever it was she made - if only to prevent a scene from happening between RNA members - you were kind of scared of her.\n\nErin hands the bottle to living Mort, and his face screws into a <<linkappend \"sneer\">>(apparently you didn't do as good of a job at hiding your frustration as you thought you did)<</linkappend>>.

Two empty wine glasses stand on the coffee table between the two of you. Bram is trying to open a bottle of Loup-Rouge with a tacky shark-shaped corkscrew, one of those ones that attaches to a keychain. Your living counterpart smirks in amusement.\n\n\"I can't get over that silly corkscrew,\" living Mort says, chuckling.\n<<add \"Corkscrew\">>\n\nAs Bram finally gets the bottle open, he replies weakly, \"I didn't buy it, it was a gift.\" He sets the bottle down on the coffee table. When he makes no move to pour any wine, Mort reaches over and begins filling up both glasses.\n\nAfter handing a glass to <<linkappend \"Bram\">>(who frowns. Hm. You don't remember that)<</linkappend>>, Mort takes a sip from his glass and sighs. You remember what it tasted like, after so long. A buttery, round wine with hints of raspberry and spice. Your favorite. You realize that was the last you'd ever taste of that wine, or any wine. Now you can't taste anything.\n\nYour own voice snaps you back to the scene. \"Thanks for getting this. You followed my note to the letter, and this is an especially good year.\" \n\nBram furrows his eyebrows and says, \"I'm a little concerned that you're drinking-\"\n\n\"Oh, it's fine,\" Mort replies, waving his hand. \"Wine doesn't have a high proof, and what's a few glasses with an old friend?\" He laughs. \"Besides, a little buzz isn't such a bad thing.

You seem even more tired than you usually are.\" Terry brushes a lock of hair off Justin's forehead.\n\n\"Yeah, it's just, I was out so late last night because - \"\n\n\"Mort?\"\n\n\"Mort.\" He sighs, his brow furrowing. \"I just wish he could get it through his head that I don't - \"\n\n\"Now now, this is a time to give thanks for the people around us, not get irrevocably angry at them.\" She gives Justin a teasing smirk, which he returns. \"In fact, I think you should give the salad to him.

For me?\"\n\n\"...Ok,\" he grunts. \"But only for you.\" \n\nHe reaches out to take the salad from Terry, but she suddenly pulls away, frowns at the bowl, and says, \"Oh sugarbites, we forgot dressing.\" She looks at Justin with wide eyes.

I'd die.\" You were just stating an objective fact, of course.\n\nA spiteful laugh. \"That bad, huh? You're not even trying to be kind.\"\n\nPast Mort tries to justify himself. \"You're offended? Annie, I don't need to be kind when //you're// putting //my// life in danger.

I'd say your brains are going with age, but I'm aging pretty well, so I guess it's just you.\" You look pretty red-faced, but yelling will do that to anyone.

The moon, nearly full, is high in the sky. Despite the clearly late hour, Justin is walking down the sidewalk, twirling his keys around his finger absentmindedly.

You remember it was kind of tacky, but that's all you recall about it.\n<<add \"Justin's Keys\">>\n\nJustin looks annoyed and is grumbling about patrolling.\n\nA figure approaches in the darkness with long blonde locks; when Justin sees her, his eyes widen and he pulls down his cap.

But that's ok. Did you like your birthday presents from me, mom, and dad?\"\n\nWait.\n\n\"I, uh. Yes. Thank you.

Now that you think about it, they do look //remarkably// similar. Their noses, their expressions - goddamn, how have you never noticed before? The biggest difference between them is their hair - Erin's is long and blonde, while Justin's is cropped and jet black.\n\n\"Look, Justin, please don't tell Mort!\" Erin exclaims suddenly. \"I - \"\n\n\"Hey, don't worry about it.\" He offers her a small half-smile. \"I'm not really eager to tell Mort anything, and as long as it's impermanent, who cares?\"\n\nTell you what? How many secrets were people hiding from you?\n\nShe lets out a small squeak of happiness and goes to hug Justin, but he backs away and puts his hand up, looking irritated.\n\nErin's face falls as her arms do, and she starts twirling her hair in her fingers, looking down again. \"Well, I answered your question. So, answer mine? What //did// you think of the crescent charm?\"\n\nJustin bites his lip, then clears his throat. \"I threw it out. I don't need reminders of that anymore. I'd rather just leave it all behind.\" Then, flatly, \"Sorry.\"\n\nErin looks like she's about to cry. \"It's...I am too.\" She walks past Justin, who stands there, unmoving, with a hard look on his face.

The rest of the scene fades in - chairs, food, the festive Thanksgiving-themed tablecloths, and the awning draped above them. As you look around you spot other RNA members, including yourself, bustling about and getting the dinner preparations set up.\n\nJustin exhales heavily and sticks his hand in his pocket, rummaging around for something. When he withdraws it, you see he's holding one of those caffeine patches and a crumpled piece of paper. You can't make out what the paper says; all you can tell is that it's written in orange ink.\n<<add \"Crumpled Paper\">>\n\nHe unceremoniously stuffs the paper back in his pocket, then peels off the backing of the caffeine patch. When he rolls up his sleeve to stick the patch on his wrist, you see that there's a faint lighter patch on his skin, square like the patch is. Is that a caffeine patch //tan line//? Wow, he must use them a lot. Come to think of it, the bags under his eyes are pretty heavy indeed...\n\nWhen you look back up, Erin is standing by Justin, and you and he jolt back in surprise. \"What is it, Erin?\"\n\n\"Um, I saw you put that patch on and - \" Justin pulls his sleeve down quickly and gives her an irritated look. \"- And I thought now would be a good time to give this to you...\" Erin pulls a piece of paper out of her bag - the sigil marked for Justin.\n\n\"What's this supposed to do?\" he says.\n\n\"Well, it's a sigil for renewal of energy and relieving of stress!\" Jeez, she's earnest about this stuff. \"You should hang it up in your house to charge it with your stress energy and exhaustion, and then you burn it after it's fully charged so it can dispel them. You may not talk to me anymore, but anyone with eyes can see how tired you've been, and I thought it might help.\"\n\nJustin takes the paper and examines it. \"How do you know if it's fully charged?\" Erin opens her mouth to speak, but then - \"Wait, what am I saying? You know I don't believe in this magic mumbo jumbo,\" he says, beginning to crumple the paper. At her visible distress, he stops and hands it back to her. \"I appreciate the sentiment but I'm fine.\"\n\nHer brows scrunch together. \"But your fatigue! You can't just keep living off of caffeine patches and coffee!\"\n\n\"Look. Terry gave me this article the other day about the health benefits of nuts; it was almost interesting. Apparently they help with tiredness and all that. And did you notice the dinner?\" He gestures to the food being set out. \"It's freaking full of nuts. It'll help me more than any magic whatchmacallit. Sorry, but no thanks.\"\n<<add \"Nut Article\">>\n\nErin looks vaguely disappointed and walks off, trying to smooth out the folds in the sigil.

Bram is outside too, staring through the wall-to-floor front windows with a shocked expression on his face, sweat beading on his forehead. You look inside as well, but all you see is some man with a cane talking to Terry. Brown hair, dress shirt; you don't find him terribly relevant at all until Terry pulls on his tie and kisses him.\n\nYou'd probably pull the same expression Bram is making, were you to still have a face.\n\nBram goes to the door and makes to open it. Is he going to confront Terry or something? You can't imagine your friend ever doing that. Apparently he's not so sure either, his hand reaching for and pulling back from the bottle-shaped handle nervously.\n\nThe door opens and Bram starts back, then the man emerges. He leans heavily on the silver-tipped cane he's holding, but otherwise he looks like your average, generic 30-something brunette guy. Unremarkable, even. And yet...\n<<add \"Cane\">>\n\nHe nods to Bram politely; Bram only eyes him warily in return. As the man walks off, Bram catches the door before it closes and heads hesitantly into the store.\n\n\"Hey Bram, how are you?\" Terry says.\n\n\"I've, uh, been better,\" he says. He glances back at the door and thumbs in that direction. \"Hey uh. Who was - who was that? The guy with the cane, I mean.\"\n\nBy gum, he's actually doing it. You never thought he had it in him.\n\nTerry stares blankly at him, then blinks and smiles. \"He's a customer here.\" She leans against the counter. \"Would you like some help finding a specific brand and year, or are you just browsing?\" \n\n\"Just brows- wait, no I'm looking for, uh,\" Bram pats his pockets for something, presumably a note with what wine he was looking for. After a moment of fruitless searching, he says, \"...Are you two friends?\"\n\n\"What?\" \n\n\"You seemed pretty friendly with him.\" Bram looks away as he speaks, incapable of looking at Terry as he accuses her. \n\nStanding upright, Terry folds her arms across her chest and\u00a0replies, \"Well, it's not like I can very well run a shop and be rude to my customers.\" You personally think she's being a little rude right now but you guess you can't blame her, given the situation.\n\nBram cringes before insisting, \"Yeah, but usually store owners don't kiss their customers.\"\n\nAt this, Terry freezes, and Bram just keeps going. \"You flirted with him, put a necktie around his neck and, uh, kissed him. Does Justin know that - \" \n\n\"No!\" Terry shouts. She puts her hands up, almost like a surrender. With an embarrassed blush blooming on her face, she says, \"Please don't tell Justin, he'd be heartbroken. He doesn't need to know.\" \n\n\"Why - nevermind, I don't want to know.\" Bram stares at Terry, who has slowly drawn her arms back and wrapped them around herself. \n\nColdly, she says, \"What are you even doing here, Bram? I thought you didn't drink.\"\n\n\"I don- I mean, m-maybe I started?\"\n\nYou inwardly scowl at his slip up as Terry looks at him suspiciously. She opens her mouth to speak but Bram quickly says, \"I guess you must've gotten tired of Justin and his bowties, huh?

The way Mort's been treatin' everyone, he needs a good kick in the pants. Or somethin' else.\" Her smile turns sly and you start to feel scared. \"I made this big, beautiful sandwich for him, y'see. He can't eat nuts right? And it's too late to remake all the food we cooked, so it's only fair he get //somethin'// to eat.\"\n\n\"That's kind of you,\" Justin says slowly, drumming his fingers on the countertop. \"And...?\"\n\n\"And I thought I might put a little you-know-what in it.\"\n\nHis eyes widen. \"Oh god, Annie, you don't mean //that// something, do you?\" What something? Nuts? Aconite? Arsenic?! When Annie nods, you feel panic rising in your nonexistent gut.

Wait.\n\nWhat?\n\n\"Oh please, it's just a prank, dear, lighten up a bit. Go to the grocery store, get the sauce, and I'll pay you back. Here, I wrote it down so you won't forget. She pulls out a scrap paper with '//sriracha sauce//' written on it in orange sharpie. Before Justin can protest, she shoves it into his hand.\n\nThat's it? You want to laugh with how giddy you feel.

You've materialized in the kitchen this time, and Bram is there, the Loup-Rouge resting on the counter. Bram's wearing the same clothing he was when you shared drinks with him - it must be the same day.\n\nThen you notice that he's muttering to himself and sweating, and he's got something in his hands. You look more closely and -\n\nIt's wolfsbane. Bram is holding a pot of wolfsbane. Bram is holding wolfsbane, and he's staring back and forth between the purple leaves and the wine. He's not...moving, just looking between the two of them. What the hell is he - he didn't -\n\nThe doorbell rings, and Bram jumps. He quickly hides the wolfsbane, walks over to the front door, and, not bothering to check who's outside, swings it open. Much to Bram's surprise, you - or rather, your past self - is not the one standing there. It's Justin. \n\n\"Hi, Bram,\" Justin says, giving a single wave. \"I'm here because - well, I came to give you this.\" Justin holds out a corkscrew (a tacky yet adorable shark). Bram takes it with a poorly-masked expression of terror on his face. Luckily Justin doesn't seem to notice. \"Terry said you'd been buying wine. And I came because I wanted to talk about something. Do you mind if I come in?\" \n\nBram wipes the sweat off his forehead with his sleeve. \"I don't know if now is the best time, I'm a little busy with, uh, busy - \" \n\nAnd then, from behind Justin, living Mort appears, smoothly saying, \"Bram and I were actually about to catch up for a bit. Hello, Justin.\" Justin whips around to face you, clearly caught off guard. You know he hates that, but it's not exactly your fault he wasn't paying attention. \"Speaking of busy,\" you continue, \"don't you have somewhere to be, Justin?\"\n\nNarrowing his eyes at living Mort, Justin says, \"I do?\" \n\n\"Don't you have to put flyers for the policeman Q&A session at the middle school?\" Mort replies.\n\n\"I did that this morning.\"\n\n\"And you met with the teens at the community center?\"\n\n\"This afternoon.\" \n\n\"And the patrols in the Wesden Hill and Orup Fells neighborhoods-\"\n\n\"That's how I spent the rest of the day.\" Justin crosses his arms. \n\n\"And the park?\" \n\nJustin pauses for a moment. \"What about the park?\" \n\n\"Did I forget to assign you to check for vandalism in the park?\" Mort puts his hand on his chin, thinking. You know that you hadn't forgotten. You just needed Justin gone for Bram's sake. \"Someone needs to do that, and I'm afraid reckless teenagers won't listen to anyone but an officer of the law.\" He looks to Bram and winks. Bram is frozen.\n\nBreathing in slowly, Justin closes his eyes. After he exhales, he opens his eyes and says in a tight voice, \"I will get right on that. Good day, Bram. Mort.\" Justin nods and walks away, and Mort lets himself in.\n\n\"Crisis averted,\" your past self says, patting Bram on the shoulder. \"It's a good thing I can get you out of things like this. Imagine if Justin had come in and found the marijuana plots here!\" He keeps walking into the living room, sitting down on the couch. \n\nBram, who'd been stiff with fear for much of the interaction, melts and walks over to the kitchen. \"I'll grab the wine.\" Opening a cabinet, Bram sighs and puts the wolfsbane away. \n\n\"I guess I do need him,\" Bram mumbles.\n\n\"What was that?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Mort.\"\n\nThe memory [[fades->Link Clues]].",

Without her glasses on, Annie is having a hard time seeing what Erin is doing.\n\nNoticing this, Erin holds the grass up. \"I'm just braiding grass. It makes it stronger. My mom taught it to me when I was a kid.\" She pauses. \"I could ward him away.\"\n\n\"What?\" Annie cocks her head to the side in confusion.\n\n\"I could ward the graveyard against Mort. He's a werewolf - \" Wait what? She thinks you're a werewolf? What kind of ridiculous - \" - so I can do it pretty easily with wolfsbane petals. He can't step over a barrier made of those, or he'll die.\" Erin ties a knot into the grass braid and places it against the tree. \"Don't worry, though,\" she adds. \"He'll know it's there, so he won't just be walking and then drop dead. He'll be able to steer clear.\"\n\nAnnie looks Erin up and down, and upon finding her to be completely serious, Annie lets out a sigh. \"Well, thanks, I guess. If Mort really is a, uh, werewolf - well, I appreciate it, Erin. Thank you.\"\n\nYou can't believe that Annie is going along with this farce - thinking you're a werewolf, how patently ridiculous!

I can feel the aura and...\" Her eyes unfocus as she thinks for a moment. Annie squints a bit but patiently waits for her to continue. \"Well, if he's a werewolf I'll need to make something to protect him too.

But that doesn't make sense since this is a memory and you are a ghost, and besides, her eyes don't quite meet yours anyway.

He looks slightly disheveled, and given Terry's similar state, it's not hard to put two and two together.

Bram is standing in front of a familiar door, a bundle of herbs and other plant substances swaddled in his arms. He's having a difficult time balancing it all, especially since he keeps reaching an arm out to knock.\n\nAfter a moment, Erin opens the door and stares up at Bram. Her expression is one of concern, and her usual cheery attitude is nowhere to be found. \"Bram,\" she says, \"you came.\" \n\n\"I brought the, uh, ingredients. What are these for, if you don't mind me asking?\" Bram looks warily down at Erin. \n\n\"Mort's going to need something to protect him.\" Erin offers out her arms to help carry the herbs, and, with only slight hesitation, Bram hands her some. Erin continues, \"I've been getting bad feelings for some time now, and I think Mort's in danger. Come in?\" She elbows the door open a little bit wider and nods inside. \n\nBram steps past her, giving a little \"thank you\" as he does. \"So what are you planning?\" \n\n\"Oh, a potion.\" Erin lets out a puff of breath and slams the door shut. \"I left the spell book out on the kitchen table. You can set everything down over there.\" \n\nAs Bram makes his way to the counter and sets down the herbs, he scans the area for the book. The room is lit by candles, which makes it a bit hard to see, but Bram seems to find it quickly because even before you can find the book amongst the mess, Bram is walking over to the stove. \n\n\"Were you baking with this? he calls over to Erin. She doesn't answer, and steps up next to him. \n\nPointing to one of the entries, Erin says, \"Here. Potion of Continued Life.\" You rush over to the entry, expecting to see wolfsbane listed but...everything seems innocuous. Huh.\n\n\"That's an odd - wait, do you think Mort's going to, uh, you know?\" Bram can't quite bring himself to say the word die. Oh, Bram. \n\n\"I think it's possible.

Caught up in some vines, extremely high up, are some <<openlink \"dollar bills.\" \"moneyText\">>dollar bills.<<replace \"#money\">>\n\nYou float on up there and see a $20 and four $1 bills, with creases from being folded repeatedly.

Her hands flutter as she speaks. \"I don't know what made me say that but no, I'm not, I swear, I'm not! I've - I've just been under so much stress lately that I don't know what I'm saying, I'm so sorry detective!

I suspected your involvement anyway. All the evidence points to you.\"\n\nEven though you saw her do it, hearing the detective confirm everything is disturbing. You wish this wasn't happening.\n\n\"Now hold on, my wife would never - \"\n\n\"Honeybear,\" Terry says through her hands as Justin begins to rise angrily from his seat. Her voice sounds different now, colder. \"Please. Sit.\"\n\nJustin slowly lowers himself back down, confused. He puts a hand on Terry's knee but she jerks away from him. She wipes her tears away, and as she looks up at the detective with red-rimmed eyes, she says, \"Alright, fine. I did it.\"\n\nHorror twists Justin's face while the detective affords themself a smile. \"Terry, what are you saying?\" says Justin, searching her expression. \"Lying to the detective won't - \"\n\n\"I'm not lying, Justin. And you shouldn't be surprised, with everything that's happened. He stomped over every one of us and acted like he could do whatever he wanted because the community adored him, or whatever they thought he was. But we know the truth, don't we?\" She looks around at the members of the RNA, her eyes bright. \"We know how much that bastard had it coming for what he did.\"\n\nJustin glares at the floor, his hands gripping the armrests of his chair. \"Terry, //why//?\"\n\n\"Because of the way he treated you. The way he treated all of us! You really wouldn't like to see an end to those countless patrols?\"\n\nJustin only grits his teeth and squeezes his eyes shut. Are those tears?\n\n\"He tore down your sigils!\" she says to Erin. She turns to Bram and adds, \"And I don't know why exactly you bought that wine, but you don't drink and we all know what Mort was.\"\n\n\"Murder is murder,\" says Bram, looking at the floor tiles.\n\nAnd in a sharp, high pitched voice, Erin says, \"My sigils were to protect from hunters like you.\"\n\nTerry exhales, nostrils flaring, and presses her lips together. She opens her mouth to speak, but Annie interrupts, scowling. \"You think any of that warrants killing a man?\"\n\n\"Don't pretend you don't understand me, Granny Smith! He's the only reason that L - \"\n\n\"Don't call me that,\" Annie snaps. \"And you're not so free of wrongdoing yourself, missy. No human on this earth gets to play angel of death, especially not someone livin' in a glass house like you are.\"\n\nTerry's eyes flit back and forth between the RNA members, searching for something she can't find. \"I was right,\" she says, louder as if that will convince people. She thrusts her hand forward, finger pointed, at the people gathered in the room. \"Even if none of you believe me, I know I was right to kill Mort! He deserved it!\"\n\n\"That's enough,\" the detective says. \"No one cares about your reasons. Nothing justifies cold-blooded murder. Nothing.\"\n\nShe glares at them.\n\nThe detective waves two officers over, one of whom pulls out handcuffs. \"Take her away.\"\n\nWhatever binds you to the land of the living breaks and you begin to fade, feeling conscious thoughts die like blown out candles.

I didn't do it, you know, and I see no reason why I would say that naturally, so I suppose the obvious conclusion is I was possessed by Mort's ghost and made to as some form of retribution.\" She states this as lightly as you would mention the weather outside, but it's so spot on that you wonder with a jolt if maybe you'd been wrong about her all this time.\n\n\"Possessed.\" The detective stares at her in disbelief, then shakes their head. \"Nevertheless, I've had several reason to suspect you as the culprit; I only hesitated because not everything added up.\"\n\nCrap, really? You were confident that it had to be her, but now this - her lack of panic, the detective's confusion, and the little things you'd decided to ignore - is filling you with waves of doubt.\n\n\"Yet, a confession's a confession.  You were the one getting wolfsbane from Mr. Locklear in the first place; your involvement makes too much sense. Frankly, the thing I'm most surprised about is that it was intentional.\"\n\nErin frowns at this, but says nothing.\n\n\"Detective,\" Justin says hesitantly, \"do you really think that she...I mean it's Erin...\"\n\nHe's right, you recognize. It's Erin. Did she really have it in her to murder you? You're starting to realize the real answer.\n\nTerry grabs Justin's hand, and he holds it loosely. You don't ponder that for too long and turn your attention to Annie and Bram. Bram's eyebrows are furrowed in as far as you think they can be, as though he's trying to figure out a very hard sudoku. Annie seems saddened and shifts a bit, opening her mouth to speak a couple times but ultimately saying nothing.\n\nThe detective shakes their head. \"My apologies, Ms. Moonchild. We're going to have to arrest you.\"\n\nAll she does is bite her lip and nod.\n\nFinally you feel yourself fading. Doubt, panic, and guilt continue to course through you.
