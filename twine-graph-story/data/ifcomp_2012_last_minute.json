Clearly you didn't MEASURE up.  Take NOTE:  if you wish to BEAT me, you need to be prepared to face the MUSIC.\"  These music-themed puns continued for another twenty minutes, including a questionable one involving the word \"pianist.\"\\n\\n\"Now, where was I?  Oh yes, the second MOVEMENT of my plan!\"  Thom tightened his goggles and began handing out pamphlets extoling the spiritual nutrients to be found through Beetroot.  He even had T-shirts and rubber awareness bracelets!  Mostly though he just injected people left and right with syringes chock-full of the beetroot fever virus.\\n\\nThe sky had become filled with dark clouds, so everything was really very dark and dramatic. So dramatic, that it was even raining and the only thing anyone could hear was thunder and the pitter patter of little rain feet plodding on the ground. The only thing that could make it more dramatic was if John Williams was doing the score, but tragically, he was killed after Thom Yorke stabbed him with a large building.\\n\\nAP and Yorke faced each other, in a very dramatic way to go with the previously set mood. AP was furious, disgusted with Yorkes henious acts! \"You're a creep, Yorke! You're a weirdo! What the hell are you doing here?? You don't fucking belong here, Yorke!!\" Yorke didn't even flinch and just smirked and rolled his eye that wasn't lazy and even had a full-time job working at a hotdog factory. \"mmmurmimspecialnowuurrmmmsofuckingspecial\" mumbled Yorke. \"And for what, Yorke, for what? All of this was just to give your life meaning? To destory the meaning of everyone elses lives and infect them with the Pacman Fever? And look what you've done to HIM!\"\\n\\nAP kneeled beside Pacman, who was lying on the ground close to death. His eyes were in the back of his head, and blood and vomit and something that looked suspiciously like semen was spurting from his mouth \"Stay with me, Pacman!\" AP pleaded as he shook pacmans limp body, \"don't you fucking leave me, man!\" a tear rolled down from APs face and onto pacmans face, who felt nothing.\\n\\nYorke suddenly started having epelictic spasms and screamed\\n\\nthere's nothing you can do!!!\\nthere's nothing you can do!!!\\nthere's nothing you can do!!!\\nthere's nothing you can do!!!\\nthere's nothing you can do!!!\\nthere's nothing you can do!!!\\neskimo in the boiler room!!!\\nthere's nothing you can do!!!\\n\\nAP refused to give up. \"Pacman, you fuck! don't leave me here! you've spent your whole life fighting ghosts, and now you're gonna be one! You're just going to become a ghost of your formerself! Come back, Pacman, don't let them win! Don't let Yorke win!\"\\n\\n\"TIME'S UP TIME'S UP TIME'S UP!!!\", screamed yorke. He hasitly waddled over to AP and kicked him right in his chubby ol' ass. AP stumbled to get back up, and felt his ass only to discover a hole there! I mean, one apart from the pooping one. \"FUCK!\" AP said to himself, \"the rain has made me all soggy! I don't stand a chance!\" \\n\\nYorke smiled in a very evil and sinister way, the way Dick Cheney does especially while rebuilding his cheese hair. Yorke striped his chest bare, revealing the synthensiser embedded there. He set it from irritating beeping... to MURDER. \"SAY GOODBYE, CHUBBY\" he screamed, as he reached for the on button. Suddenly, he felt a tap on his shoulder and he turned around.\\n\\n\"Sythensise THIS!\" said Pacman, as he punched Yorke right in the chest and sent him flying across the field. \"Pacman! you made it!\" Pacman struck a manly pose and said \"You think i'd miss this party?\"",

His eyes were in the back of his head, and blood and vomit and something that looked suspiciously like semen was spurting from his mouth \"Stay with me, Pacman!\" AP pleaded as he shook pacmans limp body, \"don't you fucking leave me, man!\" a tear rolled down from APs face and onto pacmans face, who felt nothing.\\n\\nYorke suddenly started having epelictic spasms and screamed\\n\\nthere's nothing you can do!!!\\nthere's nothing you can do!!!\\nthere's nothing you can do!!!\\nthere's nothing you can do!!!\\nthere's nothing you can do!!!\\nthere's nothing you can do!!!\\neskimo in the boiler room!!!\\nthere's nothing you can do!!!\\n\\nAP refused to give up. \"Pacman, you fuck! don't leave me here! you've spent your whole life fighting ghosts, and now you're gonna be one!

I don't stand a chance!\" \\n\\nYorke smiled in a very evil and sinister way, the way Dick Cheney does especially while rebuilding his cheese hair. Yorke striped his chest bare, revealing the synthensiser embedded there. He set it from irritating beeping... to MURDER. \"SAY GOODBYE, CHUBBY\" he screamed, as he reached for the on button. Suddenly, he felt a tap on his shoulder and he turned around.\\n\\n\"Sythensise THIS!\" said Pacman, as he punched Yorke right in the chest and sent him flying across the field. \"Pacman! you made it!\" Pacman struck a manly pose and said \"You think i'd miss this party?\"\\n",
