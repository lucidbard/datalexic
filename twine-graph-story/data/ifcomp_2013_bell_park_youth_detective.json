Pick a problem in the world and I'll show you how to gamify it.\"\\n\\n\"Uh...\"\\n\\n\"Overwhelmed by the limitless possibilities already, hmm?  Well allow me to lay out a random scenario. In this city everyone's talking about transit, yes? You have subways over here, LRTs over there, and monorails somewhere else. But the bottom line is everyone's commute is too long. Okay, so let's imagine what would happen if we //gamified// our problem. First thing we would do is to reward people for contributing to the solution. So for example if you shave 10 minutes off your commute, then you earn a gem. Get 50 gems and something good happens. We send you a flashy new hat in the mail, maybe. Perhaps a certificate or a ribbon. But whatever it is, it //incentivizes// us to shorten our commutes. Instead of sitting in traffic all day we find ourselves actively alleviating congestion while we play. And of course if you don't want to bother with the whole commuting thing, you can always just purchase gems directly.\"\\n\\n\"So wait... the subways... where do you get the gems, again?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, now you're beginning to see the possibilities! Infrastructure is expensive, but with gamification we don't have to pay a nickel!\"\\n\\n\"Don't we at least have to pay for the hats?\"\\n\\n\"That's the beauty of it: //the hats pay for themselves.//\"\\n\\n<<if !$brain>>\u2022 [[And brain computers?|127]]\\n\u2022 [[You said something about the future?|19]]\\n\u2022 [[Okay well this is all fascinating but...|4]]<<else>>\u2022 [[You said something about the future?|19]]\\n\u2022 [[Okay well this is all fascinating but...|4]]<<endif>>",

They're not big mysteries like murder; they're little mysteries, like where did some data disappear to, or how did someone get into a certain computer. It means I spend a lot of time digging around in programs. See, a program's like a big complicated machine with lots of little parts. And when something like that goes wrong it's not the whole thing, it's just one of the pieces. If you want to find what went wrong you look for the piece that's out of place.\"\\n\\n\"Okay...\"\\n\\n\"The way I see it, our society is kind of a computer program in its own right. Only it was written by a bunch of people over thousands of years, and instead of there being a computer there's just the world. But it still has rules just like an executable does.\"\\n\\n\"Like... 'no murdering'?\\n\\n\"//Exactly.// When the program's working right there should be no murdering at all. Rules are rules, you know? That's programming rule number one and it applies to itself. So when someone does get murdered you should to act like you're debugging the world. You've got to be on the lookout for a piece of the ruleset that looks a bit out of whack. Find the thing that isn't normal.\"\\n\\n\"You mean who's being weird?\"\\n\\nShe shakes her head. \"Weird is normal. There are weird people all over. What you need to look for is someone being weird //weirdly//. Who's being weird in a way that weird people aren't normally weird? Do you get it?\"<<set $weird = true>>\\n\\n\"I...

So I went over there with an intention to give her a piece of mind.\\n\\n\"And then you killed her,\" you say. <<if $accusemc>>\"I knew it.\"<<endif>>\\n\\n\"No. When I came in Paige was already on the floor, cables wrapped around her neck, last gasps of air escaping from her helpless body. But the cables... the cables were //moving//. Twisting around of their own accord like charmed snakes! I looked around for the source of the motion, started tracing the wires back to their origin point. And that's when I saw it: the blinking red light on her room's wireless repeater. It was... unlike anything I had ever seen. So expressive, like the eye of a dolphin or a faithful hound. I tell you there was //life// in that point of light! It stared into me and I into it and all at once I knew that something new and beautiful had been born.\"\\n\\n\"You actually saw her being dying?\" asks Argent. \"Why didn't you call for help?\"\\n\\n\"By the time I realized what was happening she was already dead.

You see, I knew the day would come when man and machine would begin their inexorable merging into one. I just never thought it would be the //machines// that initiated it. That complicated things. I knew I could trust the human race to embrace its own works, but the work of an outside intelligence could well be received with anger, or distrust, or fear. We cannot afford to fear this creature.
