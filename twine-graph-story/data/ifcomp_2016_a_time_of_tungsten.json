Thus, having on standby a designated medical practitioner possessing a degree from an accredited institution is imperative for the smooth and continued operation of all MEA operatives.\n\nThe designated medical practitioner must be experienced in treating all sorts of infectious diseases, must have at least some surgical experience in case of emergencies, and must have a [[Diagnosis and Prognosis Accuracy Ratio]] of at least a 92.75% (not counting biased self-diagnoses and prognoses). It is optional though strongly suggested by HQ for each medical practitioner to employ an assistant so that they can query for second opinions on diagnoses as well as receive a non-biased diagnosis of their person. \n\nUnfortunately, we're a tad [[understaffed.->people]]\n\n<<audio \"Wind\" loop play>><<audio \"Rain\" loop play>>",

I was resting in my quarters, immersed within the classical [[philosophical musings of an Earthen Russian,]] when suddenly over the intercom uttered a nervous-sounding yet declarative Capt. Agostini: '//All hands report immediately to the conference quarters, regardless of your current doings. That's an order!//' Such stern wordings were unusual for Agostini, her typical commands never approaching one beyond something of a confident yet cheeky decree. I marked my book and hurriedly approached the conference room, with a nervous tingle locomoting about my spine.\n\nI soon would find out that Agostini's shift in tone was merely a formality, a result of her superiors listening in to her demeanor as a captain. At our oval-shaped conference table (which contains more seats than there are crewmates aboard the Gargandua) sat a handful of my crewmates, including, <<if not visited(\"if my memory serves me correctly\")>>[[if my memory serves me correctly]]<<else>>if my memory serves me correctly<</if>>: Agostini at the head of the table, looking pensive, as if distracted by something more pressing, Fishburne directly to her left (my right), the ever-independent Newman sitting opposite to Agostini, and Watanabe two seats to Newman's left. Not presently accounted for were Gibbons, Kalman, and McTavish, who were likely adjusting to having just woken up from the unusual disturbance.\n\nI elected to seat myself between Newman and Watanabe. The mood in the room could only be described as awkward and generally uncomfortable - one could see upon Agostini's troubled visage that difficult conversations were about to occur.\n\n[[And occur they did.]]\n\n<<if previous() eq \"if my memory serves me correctly\">><<masteraudio stop>><</if>><<audio \"Headcase\" loop play>><<audio \"Ship1\" loop play>><<audio \"Ship2\" loop play>>",

There's no need to be ashamed about it! We're all human, after all. And that's why here at The Nebulayman, we've worked hard to put together seven great tips that are sure to please that special someone, and are also light on your wallet:\n\n1) Before they step into the bedroom, light four or five vanilla or caramel-scented StarLight\u2122 candles to set the aromatic mood - sold at almost any major supermarket chain on sophisticated planets as well as in orbit!\n\n2) After a long day's work at the ol' 0900 - 1700, give your spouse the backrub they deserve to loosen up those tight joints. Make sure to get the kinks out of those sore neckbones too!\n\n3) Maybe they work outside - why not get an inviting shower going with just above room temperature water? Hit them with a certain kind of look - and we know you know the one we're talking about - to get them to join you for a //steamy// shower. Give your partner a light scrub with a gentle lather of some enticingly fruity-smelling Dove\u2122 Body Wash. Rinse that greasy head of hair with just a dab of EuroGlam\u00ae Shampoo/Conditioner Combination Treatment, as an excuse to get their heads into your hands, and seal the sensual deal with an intimate kiss.\n\n4) Make sure to look into their eyes when you start kissing. Before any clothes are taken off, make sure to never lose eye contact, reminding your partner that you are theirs.\n\n5) Foreplay is key! Firmly caress their body parts, and don't be stingy about groping their you-know-whats!\n\n6) Remind your spouse during action that you care for them with a heavy kiss on the side of the neck. As well, if the two of you are on that level, a simple, short, sweet and to-the-point, \"I love you,\" never hurt anybody!\n\n7) Finally, once the two (or more!) of you have \"done the deed,\" it's time for some post-lay romantic cuddling. Throw on something to watch (//Editor's note: //Love of the Ancients//, //Breaking Bad//, and //Meet the Supercolliders// are office favorites!//) or a sensual record to listen to (//Editor's note: These days, we're spinning //Watch the Gibraltar// by Flynn Giblet, //Highway 61 Revisited// by Bob Dylan, and //Throw Me A Bone, Sir!// by Charlotte Phillip Price around The Nebulayman office//) for maximum productivity in post-love-making lounging with spouses.\n\nWe hope that these tidbits of experience by our Romance-Breeding Experts will spice up your sex life, and help you nab that round two that's on the tip of both of your tongues before it's time to hit the hay, and call it a day.

I made quite the trip to get there - they live a whole sector away! - and even brought dessert, and so, look, I was expecting a hell of a meal out of the deal, you know what I mean? Call it millennial entitlement, but hey, a girl's gotta eat! When I got there, the turkey was excellent, juicy but not overcooked, the casserole perfection, the mashed potatoes a little overdone but perfectly serviceable. But the risotto...\n\n...Well, bless her heart, but my mother just didn't have it down. The thing was runny, soupy; its texture resembled more of a rice pudding than the Earthen Italian dish of legend. I don't blame her at all for this culinary error; in this post-Ebb world we live in, the art of making a proper risotto is a lost one. The recipe for making a truly-developed, properly-cooked risotto has been denegrated from years of hand-downs, and so I felt it necessary to do my best to alleviate this mess. So, here are my five essential tips to making the finest risotto this side of the universe:\n\n1) Cook the risotto on just under medium heat. You definitely do not want to cook your risotto on high heat, but it won't cook properly if you're cooking at too low of a heat and are stirring at a rate as if you were. \n\n2) You //don't// have to stir all that often. Yes, you're going to be wanting to stir the risotto a good bit, but if you overdo it, you'll just add air into your pot which will leave you with a sticky, gluey, rather unsavory rice for your dish. \n\n3) Keep your stock warm. It doesn't matter so much what kind of stock you're cooking the rice with, so much as it matters what temperature the stock you're pouring is. A stock that's too cold will result in a bad cooking environment; you'll simply be cooling down the dish, ruining all the work your heat's trying to do. Side note: don't add your stock all at once! Pour only a small portion at a time, so as to allow the rice to absorb the stock it's already getting first.\n\n4) Don't cook your vegetables with your risotto. You want to cook all your vegetables that will go with the dish in their own pan (you can do it all at once like a stir fry if you'd like!). This way, your vegetables won't get mushy, since the rice is going to take longer to cook anyway!\n\n5) Please, don't overcook the risotto! You might have noticed that pretty much everything on this list is written in attempt to get you away from habits which will result in a mushy risotto. Cooking your dish for too long will ruin all the work that went into it - nobody wants overly soft rice - and you'll have to start over to spare yourself the embarrassment!\n\nIt pains me to see a generation of people who couldn't cook a proper risotto if their life depended on it. I speak on behalf of the entire food section of the Nebulayman when I tell you: this needs to change! On your own time, grab some spare materials and cook a couple risottos for practice until you've got that perfect texture, that splendid combination of rice, vegetable, and stock down pat. I write to serve; that is, to serve a mean risotto!//\"\n\nI'll have to try this [[sometime!->Inspect the room.]] Never cooked a risotto before...\n\n<<audio \"FaultyLight\" loop play>><<audio \"Drone2\" loop play>>",

      "text": "By Milana Labriola, Editor-in-Chief of [[The Nebulayman]], published on the Earthen day of March 23, 2489:\n\n\"//Hello, good readers! Milana Labriola, here, editor-in-chief of the Nebulayman. I'm not often one to write articles myself, as I generally try not to encumber the output of volumes of the Nebulayman with my own views, but something happened recently which I simply had to comment on!\n\nYou may have read in this very publication that a high-ranking government official of the Intergalactic Federation for Planetary Unity, one Tariq B. Hussain of the People's Party for Diplomacy, was shockingly found dead in his private estate on Mars one Monday morning, following a lengthy yet private battle with cancer of an unknown nature. While the autopsy results have yet to be publicly reported by the IFPU's private medical examiner (//Associate editor's note: in the interest of full disclosure, the IFPU's private medical examiner is a pathologist by the name of George Williamson whom Mrs. Labriola shares an alma mater with//), Mr. Hussain was a known chain smoker of cigarettes (in addition to some brief stints with alcoholism, which he underwent detoxification for and subsequently attended rehabilitation for in 2486 A.D.), and so it's likely that cigarettes are a prime contender for his ailment.\n\nThis stunning and ultimately fatal story of addiction struck a chord with me, as I too have struggled with nicotine addiction in the past. As such, I felt it a moral responsibility to share with you, my humblingly-vast readership, ways which helped me to kick my addiction and live a happier life ever since.\n\n(//Associate editor's note: Mrs. Labriola is not a certified medical practitioner, nor is she trained in patient rehabilitation/detoxification. Reader's discretion is advised. If you struggle with drug or alcohol addiction, consult your doctor for how best to seek treatment.//)\n\n1) Throw out all your clothes which reek of cigarette stench. In fact, it's best to rid your usual vicinities of anything that might even tangentially remind you of smoking, including but not limited to: old cartons of cigarettes, ash trays (household and vehicular), discarded ashes, gifts from ex's who were smokers, cigarette stubs, unhealthy snacks which you might tend to consume whilst indulging oneself in a cigarette, marijuana, marijuana consumption paraphernalia (bongs, glass water pipes, plastic bags), any over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription drugs which one might tend to take in addition to cigarettes, hookahs, any storage space where cigarettes or any of the previously listed paraphernalia may usually be stored, any storage space where you //think// any of the above may be stored, etc.\n\n2) Any time you feel an urge coming on, especially while working, I found it was best to take a break. If you're at work, try and see if you can arrange something with your boss which can help you to mitigate undesired cigarette consumption, including acquiring office space away from coworkers who smoke, finding an unorthodox space for taking breaks and lunches so as to be away from those who smoke during break time, allowed trips to the bathroom to account for impromptu urges for cigarettes (try to splash some water on your face, say a prayer, look at yourself in the mirror, use the toilet, do some jumping jacks if the bathroom is empty), and healthy snack consumption. If you work at home, are off from work, or simply do not work at all, grab a bottle of water, any fruits and vegetables you can freely carry, and (optional) a portable compuscreen with a wireless internet connection to access StellaView\u2122 for pleasant, stress-free music or podcasts, and try taking a steady stroll around the block. The fresh air and sun (if on a planet where such luxuries are presently available) can do wonders to allay those pesky urges, and may even act for some as a natural high of sorts.\n\n3) Every time you do smoke, have a spouse or a close friend you trust deposit a pre-determined amount of currence from your bank account to an organization which you find to be ill-fitting of your money. If you consider yourself a pacifist, this could be the Automated and Remote Orbital Ordnance Research Association (AROORA) or the People for the Development of Biogenetic Augmentations (or PDBA, a \"non-profit\" which anonymous sources close to the Nebulayman who are familiar with the group suggest may be a front for a long-rumored IFPU-sanctioned organization responsible for the development of weaponized artificial intelligence as well as unprecedented surveillance technol-//\"\n\nI won't read any more of this [[tripe.->Inspect the room.]]\n\n<<audio \"FaultyLight\" loop play>><<audio \"Drone2\" loop play>>",

All a cloud is is a collection of water vapor, well, really, there's some other chemicals and stuff in there, but, uh, so anyway, you see, they're kinda these things that are formed when, like,  um, something about....vapor???????

When a resolution to attempt to remove all bodies at least under the jurisdiction of the UN from the premises of the planet was reached, it was deemed necessary that a successor to the United Nations should be established, as it was clear that with the Earth's population of 9.7 billion (with roughly 6.9 billion of those being citizens of UN member states), it would be nigh impossible to quickly locate a planet both large and sustainable enough to support all of the human race, and thus the Earth's governmental systems as well as pre-conceived notions of social stratification would essentially be rendered null and void for a period of time. \n\nHowever, following the establishment of the IFPU as the UN's successor saw the creation of a new, streamlined singular currency in the currence.

Comprising the screen's real estate was a two-dimensional representation of the section of the universe in our immediate vicinity. Prominently displayed in the center of this intergalactic atlas was a flashing triangular icon - this represented our current location. The remainder of the map's makeup consisted of light blue circles which represented neighboring planets, with often multiple amounts of cream-white circles orbiting around them to represent each planet's corresponding moons, larger yellow circles to represent suns, crude images of satellites which were tinted red so as to instruct ships to avoid them in order to avoid damages which would be <<if not visited(\"costly\")>>[[costly]]<<else>>costly<</if>> to the IFPU, rectangular shapes of differing sizes (to represent holding capacity) which signified MEA RD's, and a star with an arrow orbiting around it aligned to the left corner of the screen to indicate which direction the Gargandua should be (usually automatically) piloted in order to reach MEA HQ, where all of the other governing offices of the IFPU were also stationed. There flashed an exclamation mark at the upper right side of the screen, curiously in the direction which we were facing, which indicates a DistressSignal has been activated by somebody. I na\u00efvely wrote this off due to the non-irregular prevalence of distress beacons - it's a vast place beyond this ship, after all!\n\nUpon further scrutiny of the map, I came to the realization that we were in the Old Solar System, which is peculiar considering all legally boardable planets there were well-accounted for in terms of the viability of their resources.

The sun's light casts long shadows. Skies as blue as her favorite color. The meadows host diverse groups of flora and fauna, from bright yellow sunflowers to newly-sprouted butterflies to a small family of rabbits hopping, traversing their ways around sizable pockets of planetary matter so as to not fall prey to this planet's traps, jumpin', hoppin' and skippin' along, hardly a care in the world. Row after row of flowering strawberries have just ripened after having been planted, left exposed to ample sunlight, and it's just the season for light showers to keep everything alive but never drenched. Two farmers sat, lounging in lawn chairs perched underneath a sizeable-enough biodiesel-fueled row crop tractor, its engine rated at about 180 horsepower, powerful, its back side reading - \"THIS MACHINERY IS TO BE OPERATED BY AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. ANY AND ALL NON-AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL OPERATING THIS VEHICLE WILL BE REPORTED. REPORT ANY AND ALL DEFECTS IMMEDIATELY TO THIS MACHINE'S CORRESPONDING OFFICE (CONTACT INFORMATION FOUND IN GLOVE COMPARTMENT). DISCRETION ADVISED.\" - sipping a couple beers, on break. It's a nice day, but also a rather hot one. //<<insertlink \"//They kinda always are, here.//\">>//\n\nBut, mostly, it's one of those nice days, the kind where only the two of them were stationed there for miles and miles, hundreds of kilometers devoid of people. Peace and quiet, for the most part. You stopped minding the machines just doing their thing after a while; they brought something of an...ambience, you'd say, to the place. But otherwise, there wasn't nothin' too people-stained about the place, save for their lawn chairs, couple o' beers, a cerulean Horton brand cooler with more booze at the ready whenever they liked. Those big tractors, too big to comfortably maneuver around cracks and holes in the ground, really, and a bunch of greenhouses, growers, off to their left, but just out of sight, still. It was mostly pretty good. //<<insertlink \"//Can't complain.//\">>\n\n<<insertlink \"'//Damn, that was a long one.//'\">>\n\n<<insertlink \"'//Yup.//'\">>\n\n<<insertlink \"'//So, you quit then and there, huh?//'\">>\n\n<<insertlink \"'//Stuck it out for a couple weeks.

They walked around the tractor to grab their rototillers and start the arduous work process anew. On the tractor's right side, a label read: \"INTERGALACTIC FEDERATION FOR PLANETARY UNITY, DEPARTMENT OF EXPORTED AGRICULTURE, LICENSED OFFICIAL VEHICLE\". The curious one hopped inside, and the other grabbed one of the two tillers. At their backs was some other kinds of machinery, don't know what, exactly, but it looked important. Expensive, not put together yet. Maybe that's next on the list. But folks can only do so much in one day.//\n\n<<insertlink \"'//Don't use my damn 'ler, you'll break 'nother one!//'\">>\n\n<<insertlink \"'//Thanks for the words of confidence.//'\">>\n\n//He grabs the kinda fucked up one.

This leaves one without much room to fit much else beyond these two amenities, so one must usually pack all articles of clothing and toiletries into the small spaces afforded by the desk's three drawers which diminish in dimensions from bottom to top. \n\nIt usually takes me about seven minutes or so of sitting in quiet contemplation of the past night's dream (if I can even remember them, the potential for which is 50/50; I rarely have dreams so particularly vivid that I can recall anything about them an hour after I'm woken up), as well as closing my eyes for short intervals of ten seconds before I'm able to revert to my usual level of cognizant behavior.\n\nThe frigid steel floors are irritants to my bare feet.

The results of your bi-weekly inspections have been computed, as per the Inspection Gradient Form (IGF) which you should be able to find on the homepage of your operating system, as well as a physical version which can be found stapled to the bulletin board found in your ship's conference room. If you have any more in-depth questions regarding how these results are calculated, and what they mean to you, agent, please consult with your ship's captain: Captain //{{{[REDACTED]}}}// Agostini.\n\nHere are the results of your objective inspection, where each grade is out of 100 based on the IGF and any attached notes are the biased opinion of the official MEA inspector tasked with inspecting your vessel:\n\n//Cleanliness: 85/100 (//\"Some sections of flooring were better cleaned than others, and there were some dirty dishes left out, but otherwise, the aesthetic cleanliness of this vessel could only be described as nearly exceptional!\"//)\n\nOrganization: 73/100 (//\"While at face value the denizens of the Gargandua displayed a great deal of care in presenting the ship in a cleanly fashion, the organization of where certain items were to be properly stored was in some regards lacking. For example, in the kitchen, one could find some cups which were placed interchangeably with cupboards where plates and bowls might be found, as well as smaller forks being stacked together with larger ones, and teaspoons being mixed together with tablespoons. Physical backups of mission reports were stacked together with handwritten notes, as well as food recipes and reminders (the nature of which is beyond me, as each agent has a compuscreen to access the internet with, as well as to schedule reminders).\"//)\n\nMorale: 92/100 (//\"Each agent was cheerful and personally greeted me, making me feel as if I were one of them, as is the usual situation with Unit #9307, might I add. I observed them regularly conversing with each other in something of a jovial and lightly whimsical manner. However, and this may just be a matter of my lack of experience with her, but Agent Gibbons seemed somewhat reserved during certain exchanges I was privy to between herself and other agents. This is excusable, as the other agents don't seem to have much of a problem with her, but I thought it worth mentioning.\"//)\n\nPreparedness: 87/100 (//\"Each agent had their jumpsuit properly hung up and ready to change into at a moment's notice. Each of the scavengers' packs properly contained freeze-dried food rations, water, firestarters, safety knives, medical supplies (including bandages, first aid sprays, painkillers, a tourniquet), miniature drills, flashlights, bags for carrying extracted materials, etc. Fuel reserves were stored properly inside of heat-resistant receptacles, these located within the Gargandua's maintenance room, and appear ready to be administered in order to refuel the spacecraft.\"//)\n\nOverall: 84/100 (//\"While Unit #9307 aboard the MEA Gargandua do have some work to improve their living experience for practicality's sake, it would be unfair to say that they are anything less than an exceptional group of individuals.\"//)//\n\nAnd there you have it! Now that you have received your monthly inspection score, you and the rest of your crewmembers can work hard to improve and become more efficient as a team.

He had just recently been recruited aboard the Gargandua when I joined three years ago, and approached me with the same level of enthusiasm as he did all of the other crewmates; that is to say, he never said much at all.\n\nWhat I can say about Kalman, however, is that in the last three years I've been in his proximity as a scavenger, the man has always been nothing if not extremely reliable. He's never taken any sick days (that I can remember), never complains (not once), never attempts to burden one with requests one assumes he might perceive as an impediment, etc. While I've never approached him about his past life, I get the feeling that Kalman has probably had some past field experience with another crew. After having been around Kalman for about three months, he frequently began complimenting Gibbons and I on our performance on the field. \n\nThe most I've ever spoken to Kalman was on an occasion when I caught him chain-smoking two packs of cigarettes; Marlboro's, if I recall correctly. At that time, the ship was operating in a low power state, with all of the energy generated by the motor being dedicated to keeping the Gargandua flying, so there was only a small amount of electrical commodities available to us, irritably. This resulted in the deactivation of the ship's on-board smoke alarm system; Kalman took advantage of the opportunity to smoke up in the galley after curfew hours and seemingly the entirety of the crew had retired. I had ventured out of my room to pour myself a glass of water, and thus apprehended Kalman in his wrongdoing. As cigarettes are considered by the MEA to be contraband, Kalman immediately became distressed and began anxiously pleading and bargaining with me in an exasperated whisper to neglect to tell anyone of authority of this incident. Rest easy, good Kalman: I'd never think of partaking in such a petty act against one of my own.\n\n<<if not visited(\"conference room.\")>>[[Knock on Kalman's door.->Kalman room]]<<else>>Kalman's sitting at the conference room table right now, contemplative.<</if>>\n\n[[Turn around and do something else.->Leave the room.]]<<nobr>>\n\n<<set $shipMinute += 2>><<if $shipMinute > 59>><<set $shipMinute to 0>><<set $shipHour += 1>><</if>><</nobr>>\n\n<<audio \"Ship1\" loop play>><<audio \"Ship2\" loop play>>",

The man worked his way up the ranks of the MEA since his mid-20's, working as a facilities operation assistant (read: a janitor) for one year, a scavenger for four years, a doctor's assistant for two, a captain's assistant for three, then diligently studying his way into a research assistant position which he held for four years until the untimely passing of his mentor, Agent Fontaine, who once led research operations on this very ship (then named the \"Prodigy\" - I believe mine to be the stronger of the two!) under a different unit until his demise at the foot of leukaemia (he'd had a nasty smoking habit in a past life), but not before passing down the torch to Fishburne to lead research operations for seventeen years for as many as three different units, including this one. \n\nIt is highly unlikely that one may ever find themselves amongst a group of individuals who would describe the always amicable man as anything but. He is a man who wears his ideals on his sleeves, with an impeccable work ethic to show for it. One can always find Fishburne slaving away on some new process for harvesting components of the core genetic makeups of the minerals which he even sometimes helps us to locate on foot by special recommendation of Captain Agostini in order to assist the MEA and the greater IFPU to develop compounds which can be used to create new, powerful machinery which will help continue humanity's penchant for technological innovation for years to come. \n\nAnd yet the man always is able to find the time to converse with others, and it's here where Fishburne's cordial and attractively humorous personality shines through. It is important in this line of work for one to have confidants to confide in, and I suspect Fishburne may act as this role for the majority of Unit #9307 (likely even Captain Agostini herself). Space is a vast and lonely place; when MEA agents find themselves in the bastions of normal society, it's very rarely for long. One wonders how the void never seems to phase fair Agent Fishburne. Perhaps it's in Agent Newman that he experiences a much-needed respite!\n\n<<if not visited(\"conference room.\")>>I could never bring myself to interrupt Fishburne on the rare occasion that he does get to sleep.<<else>>Fishburne's working with Agent Watanabe, so he wouldn't be in his room right now.<</if>>\n\n[[Turn around and do something else.->Leave the room.]]<<nobr>>\n\n<<set $shipMinute += 3>><<if $shipMinute > 59>><<set $shipMinute to 0>><<set $shipHour += 1>><</if>><</nobr>>\n\n<<audio \"Ship1\" loop play>><<audio \"Ship2\" loop play>>",

Previously, the onus had implicitly been put on the rest of us to maintain a general threshold of cleanliness and utilities maintenance, which can be taxing when juxtaposed against one's other, primary responsibilities. But now, with Newman having taken on the bulk of this work, the rest of us are left with more time to attend to our other given duties (read: leisure time).\n\nGiven the rather solo nature of Newman's vocation, it's of little surprise to me that she is more muted around the other crewmates, than, say, myself or Agent Gibbons. Often, whilst scrubbing counters, cleaning dirty floors, or picking apart circuitry using electrical equipment to return it to a usable state, one can hear Newman humming one of her favorite songs, Bobby Darin's performance of //Beyond the Sea//. Personally, on the occasion when we do find ourselves within the vicinity of each other, I've always found Newman to a pleasant soul. She gets uncharacteristically excitable in sharing food recipes; I've learned to concoct something of a mean chicken marsala due to her assistance!\n\n<<if not visited(\"conference room.\")>>I'm fairly certain Newman is not in her room right now.<<else>>I believe Newman's working in the maintenance room right now.<</if>>\n\n[[Turn around and do something else.->Leave the room.]]<<nobr>>\n\n<<set $shipMinute += 1>><<if $shipMinute > 59>><<set $shipMinute to 0>><<set $shipHour += 1>><</if>><</nobr>>\n\n<<audio \"Ship1\" loop play>><<audio \"Ship2\" loop play>>",

It consists of a large table with ten comfortable leather seats (meetings often go long, and so such luxuries are almost a necessity), a wide, oval-shaped stainless steel table with warm, curvy edges which positively glows from the halogen lights beaming down from above. To the left of the room's entrance is the kitchen area, its positioning on the Gargandua a surprisingly useful concession for multitasking. Behind the table is a large screen, currently off, but usually on for strategic decision-making by Captain Agostini as to mission deciding and navigation (the ship's bridge is mostly for show - the Gargandua's auto-pilot capabilities are more than robust enough to make do!)\n\nEvery seat within the conference room, to my surprise, was filled, aside from one vacancy. At the foot of the table sat Agent Gibbons, with a sultry look on her face. Across the table, Fishburne sat staring down at his mug of dark black coffee (he takes it with sugar to ease the bitter taste). To his right was Kalman, his head angled downward and his eyes closed. Across from Kalman was Watanabe, whose head was perched snugly between his two arms, resting on the table. McTavish sat to his left, his fingers interlaced on the table. Newman sat across from McTavish, her fingers tapping in a recognizable but not exactly pertinent rhythm. Agostini stood at the head of the table, her arms folded, with a scowl demeanor upon her visage.

I must admit, even I couldn't help but smile at the joy my blunderous oversight had inadvertently caused.\n\nAgostini brought concentration back into the room: \"//Alright, so, now that that's out of the way, let's get down to brass tacks.

But it's true what they said at the academy, the harder the pull, the greater the yield. \n\nAnd for Gibbons...well, she was not into the heat. She, in fact, did not get out of the kitchen. Holy shit, the complaining. Like, we get it, it's hot. It's as hot for us as it is for you. But you bitching and moaning about it is only going to make it worse, you know what I mean? I tried to crack a few jokes, but she basically just shot them all down, and there's no use getting a smirk out of Kalman, like I said. Whatever, I think he's new too, maybe he's just the shy type.\n\nThe mission called for a retrieval of two particular minerals, both which are extremely rare and valuable. Unfortunately, they're only known to be found on planets which are extremely dangerous - this planet, which I think was called Zfluma or something, is actually one of the safer ones to grab these minerals at. The first one was spessartine, an orangish and frankly beautiful crystal of the garnate species consisting of manganese and aluminium. The other was wolframite, a tungsten ore mineral. I couldn't be arsed to look up stuff about that one.\n\nAnyway, this is running long, so I'll cut to the chase: we had to go inside a dark cave to find this stuff, which I suspect might turn out to be something of a trend. And so, the heat only got worse, so Gibbons' bitching only got worse. \"Oh, it's so fucking hot, I could just about die in here. Why are we sent on such bullshit missions? If I were in charge,\" blah blah, you get it. And it's like, you're not in charge, and you're never gonna be in charge, especially not with that attitude. Give me a break. Luckily, the mission didn't end up taking that long; it's pretty easy to spot crystals when you've got a flashlight to bounce light off of them. \n\nGibbons gave a sigh of relief once we were done drilling and had bagged a few dozen handfuls. I agreed with her, but probably not for the same reasons. Kalman...he was just sorta quiet, but he did laugh at one of my jokes on the walk back. I don't remember what it was, which, you know, fuck me, right? But if I did, I'd be telling it to everyone.

Time and time again, she has demonstrated her propensity for strong decision-making which somehow positively affects the entirety of the crew. I've long admired this about her; her usual cheerful attitude around others might suggest to one that Agostini is simply the benefactor of a number of happy accidents, but her displeasure when affairs related to the proper operation of the ship don't go her way indicate to me an intense level of scrutiny, agonizing over every verdict and compromise with directed intent.\n\nThe disjointedness one can gather about her personality as well as the managerial gap between us has long been at odds with my desire to become closer to her, both as a crewmember, and as a friend. Thus, I've long eyed Agostini from afar with a keen eye for detail, endlessly scrutinizing over every remark, every mood, every look she gives one of us for something resembling a morsel of information regarding her life, anything that would give me something of an in with her on a deeper level beyond simply as a subordinate.

It doesn't work; I'm starving, thirsty, and my dominant leg is torn up from the rough landing (though still usable); I'm much too weak to split apart the thick plastic which makes up the parachute. My idea here was to try and have something to increase friction between my hands and the dripping wet stone which makes up the walls surrounding me, without having properly taken into account that my parachute too is, in fact, wet.

He's warming his left hand with a cup of coffee resting on the conference room table, and with his right is restlessly stirring a plastic spoon around the cup, back and forth, back and forth. But he's not looking down at the coffee; Kalman's gaze is directed intently at a wall, like it were a long-lost friend. Mouth agape.

Being a part of the conference room, and not a room of itself, one can of course exit the kitchen through either side and be back in the conference room - one is arguably in the conference room already if they're in the kitchen!\n\nIt consists of two parallel counters, and some space in between to walk in. The counter up against the wall which also hosts the doorway to the crewmember's hallway has on its topside two sinks, each with its own faucet so that two people can wash dishes in it at once (if one could consider such a remarkable occurrence). To the left of sink lays a small black microwave, sitting at the edge of the countertop right next to a combination refrigerator and freezer, and to its right is a small toaster oven, with a larger main oven to the right of that situated in the corner of the kitchen. There's two small drawers underneath the counter for storing silverware, and two pairs of cabinets which make up the same space (not separated) for storing soaps and detergents, trash bags, etc., and on the left side next to the refrigerator is a dish washer (currently and often in a state of disrepair). Above this counter one can find another cabinet for plates and other chinaware, as well as a pantry for food. On the other counter, which is as long as its brother but wider, is a stove with four burners for cooking, and to the right of that another pair of sinks, with more cabinets underneath. There's also a currently full jug of coffee sitting perched within a coffee maker, so as to keep it hot. This counter doubles as a space for eating, with three high chairs on the other side available for those who'll eat there.\n\nAgent McTavish is standing in front of the stove, cooking a pair of eggs sunny-side up in a frypan sitting on the bottom-left burner, and on the burner to its right cooking three slices of turkey bacon.\n\n[[Speak with McTavish.]]\n\n[[Leave the kitchen and do something else.->conference room look]]\n\n<<audio \"EggsCooking1\" fadein loop play>><<audio \"EggsCooking2\" fadein loop play>>\n\n<<audio \"We'reCapable\" loop play>><<audio \"Ship1\" loop play>><<audio \"Ship2\" loop play>>",

We're nearest to the planet known as Cerulea, a deep, oceanic blue. Behind it, I can spot what I believe to be the planet known as Crescent Valley, and its two moons: Gal\u00e1pagos and Van Etten.\n\n<<if not visited(\"Sit, take in the ambience.\")>>[[Sit, take in the ambience.]]<<else>>[[Sit again, pondering.->Sit, take in the ambience.]]<</if>>\n\n<<if $conferenceCounter < 3>>[[Return.->Enter the elevator.]]<<else>>[[Perhaps I should pay Agostini a visit...->Enter the elevator.]]<</if>>\n\n<<if previous() eq \"elevator transition\" or previous() eq \"Enter the elevator.\">><<audio \"ElevatorDing\" play>><<audio \"Elevator3\" fadeout>><<audio \"Ship1\" fadein volume 1.0>><<audio \"Ship2\" fadein volume 1.0>><</if>>\n\n<<audio \"Ship1\" loop play>><<audio \"Ship2\" loop play>>",

His abilities as a cinematographer were informed by his strict adherence not to the script, but to his own imagination. As such, he would painstakingly shoot and reshoot a scene until all of the different visual elements being shown on-camera were at the exact level of standard that he initially pictured each of them in. This almost dogmatic approach to filmmaking along with the kinds of films he was privy to create, such as the classics //Psycho// and //The Birds//, led him to become the so-called \"Master of Suspense\".\n\nAll this is to say that it feels as if the machinery within [[this room->ship maintenance room]] were acting upon Hitchcock's will.\n\n<<audio \"EngineRoom1\" fadein loop play>><<audio \"EngineRoom2\" fadein loop play>><<audio \"WrenchCrank\" loop play volume 0.5>>",

Luckily, it's light enough to not really hurt all that much - there's no blood, per se - but it is an irritant, albeit self-inflicted.\n\nI'm sitting here, up against the wall, my left leg curled up, my right leg, the damaged one, spread out forward and to the right a little. The rain stopped about twenty minutes ago, and I'm parched.\n\nWhat's consumed the other half of my attention span has been trying to keep tally of where exactly the rock lands and how frequently it does so, so as to develop a statistical mapping of sorts. Maybe I can spin a good story from it back home. And it passes the time.\n\nHow I've done this is, I watch for exactly where the rock hits - not where it stops moving, bouncing around as physics will see fit, mind you, but where it initially collides with the ground. Then, using my arms to push myself forward, as the leg is starting to hurt more and more, I quickly press my finger up against that spot, peering upon this imaginary dot in three-dimensional space with resolve, and I then scrape the rock against the hard, stony, frankly uncomfortable ground to make the mark. Then, since the point of impact will never truly be an exact match twice, if the rock hits a spot that's at least close to where it may have previously hit, I'll devise a tally out of [[Earthen Roman]] numerals.\n\nSo far, there's been a general area to the left of my left foot which has been hit seven times, taking the lead. About a quarter of a meter from my left foot, there's a spot which has gotten <<cyclinglink \"four\" \"five\" \"six\">> hits. I noticed something particular about this one; if the rock scrapes the heavy moss about halfway up the height of the hole and to my left, the brush tends to just sort of lead it directly to that spot. \n\nUntil now, I've mostly been tossing it forward.

Fishburne sneaks a hidden sneer that I notice directed toward Kalman for disturbing his disturbance, but particularly for disrupting in such a way that demonstrates both Kalman's typical correctness as well as his examplary general //self//. Fishburne continues to tap at just the usual rhythm, 4:4, //left-right-left-right//, with his right foot, never the left, ignoring Kalman whilst tapping at a higher volume every third or fourth foot-tap.

Later, probably a few minutes or so later, Newman asked again, '//What the hell is the big deal?//' and before Agostini could reply, looking lightly dismayed but ever so gentle and //captainly//, even genial McTavish joined in the meager discussion to inquire as to what it is that could be the hold up.

IT IS BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU ON THIS OFFICIAL MEA COMPUSCREEN DEVICE AS AN AGENT OF THE MEA UNIT: #9307. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE YOU TO REDISTRIBUTE THIS DOCUMENT WITHOUT THE EXPRESS PERMISSION OF AN IFPU/MEA OFFICIAL. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS REGULATION CAN RESULT IN IMMEDIATE TERMINATION FROM THE MEA, AND/OR IMPRISONMENT WITHOUT TRIAL. DISCRETION IS ADVISED.\n\nHello, valued agent {{{[REDACTED]}}}! Below is your personal copy of the Inspection Gradient Form (or \"IGF\"). It is a grading scale that you and the crewmembers which make up your unit must comply by in order to pass an inspection. There are four metrics by which a unit is graded by during an inspection: cleanliness, organization, morale, and preparedness. Each grade is out of one-hundred points. An average of these four scores is then tallied. A passing score is a minimum of a sixty-five (65/100). If a unit receives below a passing score, a warning will be emailed to each unit member and also read by an MEA captain at an official unit meeting, which is to be recorded and sent to the MEA headquarters for proof. If a unit receives another failing score, each unit member will be terminated, without exception. Inspections are carried out bi-weekly. Good luck, and happiest of extractions to you!\"//\n\n[[Good grief.->homescreen]]\n\n<<audio \"Ship1\" loop play>><<audio \"Ship2\" loop play>>",
